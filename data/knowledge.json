      "main_content": "12 Popular Questions\nI received my ERC money, but I made a mistake in applying for it. How do I return the money?\nYou should create an amended Form 941-X correcting the error or multiple 941-Xs correcting the errors (Yes, this could mean that you are filing a 941-X amending a prior 941-X – no problem).\nYou pay separately for each 941-X\nYou can pay using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS), by credit or debit card, or by a check or money order\nSend the 941-X via certified mail to the appropriate location listed on page 6 of the instructions. Note that there’s a special address on page 6 if you use a private delivery service such as FedEx or UPS\nFor the ERC aggregation rules, do I include all the business entities I own - even those with no employees?\nYes. And this includes those real estate rentals that you treat as businesses rather than as passive investments.\nYou pay separately for each 941-X\nYou can pay using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS), by credit or debit card, or by a check or money order\nSend the 941-X via certified mail to the appropriate location listed on page 6 of the instructions. Note that there’s a special address on page 6 if you use a private delivery service such as FedEx or UPS\nWe filed our 2020 and 2021 S corporation income tax returns. We are now preparing 941-Xs to claim the ERC, which will increase our reported income in those prior years. When do we amend the 2020 and 2021 corporate returns to reduce the wages?\nYou have until March 15, 2024 to amend the 2020 S corporation return. You could amend now, but we recommend waiting until you receive the ERC monies, for two reasons:\nYou may not yet have the money needed to pay the increased federal income taxes caused by the ERC, which you will receive later\nYou may not receive the money – this is unlikely, but possible for a variety of reasons\nUnder the ERC aggregation rules, we have two companies to aggregate. One of the companies started on July 1, 2019. How does that work?\nFor the July 1, 2019, company, you use the gross receipts from the third quarter of 2019 as the gross receipts for quarters one, two, and three, and the gross receipts of the fourth quarter of 2019 for the fourth quarter.\nIn the quarter when I suffered a partial shutdown, does that shutdown also carry over to the next quarter? For example, for a shutdown in Q4 2020, does that carry over to Q1 2021?\nNo, no, no. First, the ERC for a shutdown applies only to the time of the shutdown. Thus, there’s likely no full quarter for Q4 in your question. For example, if you were shut down for three weeks in Q4, you can qualify for the ERC under the shutdown rules for those three weeks only.\nThe North Carolina governor issued a state of emergency order requiring a shutdown. It lasted for one week. What’s my ERC qualification?\nYou have one week of qualification under the shutdown order. But you may have much more should you qualify under the decline-in-gross-receipts test.\nIgnoring the test for a “significant decline” in gross receipts, is the COVID-19 shutdown effect on a business defined only by gross receipts?\nNo, for the government-ordered shutdown, you have three possibilities for determining the effect:\nDemonstrate by facts and circumstances that you suffered either a more-than-nominal effect or, in the case of a modification, an inability to provide goods and services.\nUse the safe harbor for nominal effect. This requires looking at either your 2019 quarterly receipts or your 2019 quarterly hours worked by employees.\nFor the modification safe harbor, the IRS deems that the federal, state, or local COVID-19 government order had a more-than-nominal effect on your business if it reduced your ability to provide goods or services in the normal course of your business by not less than 10 percent.\nIs the “ability to provide goods or services” demonstrated by production volume or unit sales?\nThe IRS says this is a facts-and-circumstances test. To use this safe harbor means you need a reasonable basis that demonstrates a 10 percent or more reduction in your ability to provide goods or services.\nProduction volume and unit sales seem like good candidates to demonstrate the effect of the government order that modified your ability to provide goods and services.\nTo qualify under the modification of our business, does the supply of rubber need to suffer by not less than 10 percent?\nNo. It’s the effect the COVID-19 government shutdown order had on your business’s ability to provide goods and services because it could not obtain the rubber.\nIf there was no shutdown order and no reduction in income or profit, could a business still qualify for the ERC?\nPossibly, but unlikely. Without a shutdown order, you have to compare the gross receipts quarter by quarter to those in 2019. You need a drop of more than 50 percent in 2020 and a drop of more than 20 percent in 2021 to trigger any ERC.\nIf inside dining was more than 10 percent of revenues prior to the shutdown, does the business qualify for the ERC during the shutdown even if it has three times the profit and revenues?\nYou determine nominal effect by looking back at the 2019 numbers, and if the shutdown action affected not less than 10 percent of the quarterly revenues or hours of work, you earn the ERC for the time of the shutdown.13 For this test, you are not looking at 2020 or 2021. You look at 2019.\nSo, yes, you can qualify for the ERC even with larger profits and revenues.\nI am a home builder. My generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financials, which are based on the percentage-of-completion method, show that my total revenues in 2021 are significantly higher than those in 2019. But my 2021 quarterly income tax revenues compared with 2019, which are based on the completed-contract method, show a greater than 20 percent decline in quarters one and three. It seems wrong to me that I qualify for the ERC.\nFirst, yes, you do qualify, because the ERC is based on Section 448(c) of the tax code, and that uses your tax accounting method.\nNow that you know you qualify, you have two choices:\nThank the government for the gift, claim the ERC, and take the money\nSatisfy your guilt by not claiming the ERC"

Through the founder’s own entrepreneurial experiences, as well as from client feedback, Occams Advisory was created, from day one, to serve the small business market by addressing the most pressing needs of entrepreneurs. Our name is inspired by the principle of Occams Razor, propounded by William of Occam (1288-1348 AD), an English Franciscan friar and scholastic philosopher. Occams Razor is a line of reasoning that says the simplest answer is often correct. Occams Advisory uses this spirit of problem-solving to provide simple solutions to complex problems, focusing on tangible results, measurable impact and continuous improvement.\nOur Philosophies\n“Through our observations and learnings, we have created a logical and sequential O.C.C.A.M.S set of Values and Principles, across Emotional, Intellectual and Physical dimensions that human beings operate in. Our beliefs are grounded in latest and most advanced scientific research that explore the effects that emotions have on our entire being originating from cells in particular, on our chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA. Leading scientists and neurologists have aligned to conclude that our emotions can shape our physical reality at the molecular level. Hence, we at Occams emphasize upon Emotions: Feelings as the single most critical building block of Intellect: Thinking which drives and executes our Physical: Being. Click on the Trinity of O.C.C.A.M.S. philosophies that lay out our model of an ideal individual, intellectual and professional.”\nOur Impact\nIn a world where over a billion people suffer from malnutrition, and even more lack access to clean water, the challenges are immense. About one child in every five receives no education and is at risk. With the world's population set to grow by at least two billion over the next three decades, primarily in the developing world, these challenges can compound. At Occams Advisory, we take the right action by partnering with organizations like ChildLiteracy.com to implement preventative and remedial steps, working toward a brighter future for all.\nKnow More\nOur Contributions\nAt Occams Advisory, we believe in the importance of cultural diversity and fostering global connections. It's our pleasure to share that we are a silver-level sponsor of the World Culture Festival , taken place at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on the September 29 to October 1st, 2023. This three-day celebration showcased incredible talent from around the world and left a lasting impact on how we perceived and connected with one another. We're proud to be a part of this unique event, which embodies our commitment to cultural diversity and community engagement."

      "main_content": "COVID-19-Related Employee Retention Credits: Determining Which Employers are Eligible to Claim the Employee Retention Credit FAQs\n16. Is the Employee Retention Credit available to employers of any size?\nYes. The number of employees an employer has does not affect whether it is an Eligible Employer that may claim the credit.\n17. What is a \"trade or business\" for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?\nFor purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, “trade or business” has the same meaning as when used in section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) other than the trade or business of performing services as an employee. Under section 162 of the Code, an activity does not qualify as a trade or business unless its primary purpose is to make a profit and it is carried on with regularity and continuity. The facts and circumstances of each case determine whether an activity is a trade or business. A taxpayer does not necessarily need to make a profit in any particular year in order to be in a trade or business as long as a good faith profit motive is present.\nFor purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, a tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c) of the Code that is exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Code is deemed to be engaged in a “trade or business” with respect to all operations of the organization.\n18. Are Federal, State, or local government entities eligible to receive the Employee Retention Credit? (updated November 16, 2020)\nNo. The Federal government, the governments of any State or political subdivision thereof, and any agency or instrumentality of those governments are not Eligible Employers and are not entitled to receive the Employee Retention Credit. However, tribal governments and tribal entities may be Eligible Employers. See Are tribal governments and tribal entities eligible for the Employee Retention Credit?\n19. What organizations are considered an \"instrumentality\" of the Federal government, or of a State or local government, for purposes of determining if an employer is eligible for the Employee Retention Credit?\nIn general, for employment tax purposes, the IRS considers six factors in determining whether an organization is an instrumentality:\nwhether the organization is used for a governmental purpose and performs a governmental function;\nwhether performance of the organization’s function is on behalf of one or more States or political subdivisions;\nwhether there are any private interests involved, or whether the States or political subdivisions involved have the powers and interests of an owner;\nwhether control and supervision of the organization is vested in a public authority or authorities;\nif express or implied statutory or other authority is necessary for the creation and/or use of such an instrumentality, and whether such authority exists; and\nthe degree of financial autonomy and the source of its operating expenses.\nSee Rev. Rul. 57-128, 1957-1 C.B. 311. No one factor is determinative; instrumentality status is based on all the facts and circumstances. These same factors apply to identify an instrumentality for purposes of determining whether an employer is eligible for the Employee Retention Credit.\n20. Are tax-exempt employers eligible for the Employee Retention Credit?\nYes, organizations described in section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Code, may be Eligible Employers for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit if they are employers that otherwise meet the requirements to be eligible for the credit.\n21. Are tribal governments and tribal entities eligible for the Employee Retention Credit? (updated November 16, 2020)\nYes. Any tribal government or tribal entity that carries on a trade or business may be an Eligible Employer for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, if it otherwise meets the requirements for the credit.\nAs a general rule, whether activities constitute a trade or business for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit is determined under section 162 of the Code. However, because tribal governments are not subject to income tax under the Code and, therefore, are generally not otherwise required to determine whether a tribal activity is a trade or business under section 162 of the Code, the Treasury Department and the IRS have concluded that the section 162 standards are not the appropriate bases for determining whether a tribal government is carrying on a trade or business for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. Instead, solely for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, a tribal government is treated as carrying on trade or business activities, and all activities conducted by the tribal government will be considered part of those trade or business activities. In addition, solely for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, any entity that a tribal government reasonably believes shares the same tax status as the tribal government (tribal entity employer) is treated as carrying on trade or business activities, and all activities conducted by the tribal entity employer will be considered part of those trade or business activities. Any entity other than a tribal government or a tribal entity employer must determine whether its activities constitute carrying on a trade or business under section 162 for purpose of determining eligibility for the Employee Retention Credit.\n22. Are employers in U.S. Territories eligible for the Employee Retention Credit?\n23. Are self-employed individuals eligible for the Employee Retention Credit?\nSelf-employed individuals are not eligible for the Employee Retention Credit with respect to their own self-employment earnings. However, a self-employed individual who employs individuals in its trade or business and who otherwise meets the requirements to be an Eligible Employer may be eligible for the Employee Retention Credit with respect to qualified wages paid to the employees.\n24. Are household employers eligible for the Employee Retention Credit?\nNo. Household employers are not considered to operate a trade or business and, therefore, are not eligible for the Employee Retention Credit, with respect to their household employees. However, household employers who are also employers operating a trade or business and who generally report employment taxes attributable to their household employees on the same Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Tax Return, or Form 944, Employer’s Annual Federal Tax Return, used to report the employment taxes attributable to the employees in the trade or business, may be eligible for the Employee Retention Credit, but only with respect to the trade or business employees and their qualified wages from the trade or business."

It included two programs to assist businesses with keeping workers employed: the Payroll Protection Program (PPP) administered by the Small Business Adminstration and Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) administered by the Internal Revenue Service.\nPPP funds are distributed based on 2.5 months of payroll and a minimum of 80% of the funds must be used on payroll to be eligible for forgiveness. Additionally, PPP funds are not taxable as revenue and you may still take deductions for the payroll covered by PPP.\nERTC tax credits, however, are credits (or refunds) for a percentage of payroll in each quarter that you qualify. There are specific rules for determining eligibility by quarter, and limiting the dollars that can be claimed for each employee.\nERC eligibility requirements\nEmployer eligibility is largely determined by one of two key factors, at least one of which must apply in the calendar quarter the employer wishes to utilize the credit: Full or partial closure due to a government order. A business is eligible for the ERC if they were forced to fully or partially suspend operations (FPSO) or reduce business because of a government COVID-19 order. Credit applies only for the part of the quarter the business is suspended, not the entire quarter. There are certain businesses that generally do not meet this description and would not qualify:\nThose considered essential, unless they have supply of critical material or goods disrupted in a manner that affects their ability to continue to operate. Businesses shuttered but continuing their operations largely as normal (telework). A significant decline in gross receipts\nFor tax year 2020, the business must have seen a 50 percent drop in gross receipts when comparing a quarter in 2020 with the corresponding quarter in 2019.Beginning in 2021, businesses must have seen more than a 20 percent drop in gross receipts in Q1 and Q2 compared to the same quarter in 2019. A new business is allowed to use gross receipts for the quarter in which it started business as a reference for any quarter in which it did not have 2019 figures.\nWhat are “qualified wages” and how to claim credits?\nQualified wages are compensation paid by an employer to some or all FTE’s in the relevant quarter. Qualified wages include the employer’s qualified health plan expenses that are allocable to the wages.The ERC is applied to employer’s contribution to Social Security & Medicare taxes and is fully refundable. In order to claim ERC, you must calculate total qualified wages and the related health insurance costs for each quarter, and retroactively claim the credit through Form 941-X.\nThe Million Dollar Question is . . . Do They Have The Time?\nDo they have the time to dig into the text of American Rescue Plan Act of 2021\nAnd its accompanying referenced laws like: CARES Act, Families First Act, Payroll & Healthcare Enhancement Act, PPP Payroll Flexibility Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act.\nTime to read the IRS Interpretations and FAQ’s ? And cross-reference those definitions with that of PPP which was separately defined and dissimilarly interpreted in the Small Business Administration’s Bulletins and IFRs?\nDo they have the time to ensure accuracy in eligibility determination, maximize your computation and create the supporting documentation you’ll need to support an IRS audit of employer taxes?\nSo far, we have not found a bookkeeper who is able to take all this on, while handling the day-to-day of bookkeeping. If yours can, then take them up on their offer. We’re happy to take a second look.\nHow does the number of employees factor into the ERC?\nThe rules are different depending on how many employees you have. The updated 2021 program bumped these categories up from 100 full-time employees (FTE’s) in 2019 to 500 FTE’s in 2019. Employers with 500 or fewer FTE’s in 2019 can apply the ERC towards all qualified wages paid to employees during those quarters, whether or not employees were working at the time. Employers with more than 500 full-time employees can apply the ERC towards qualified wages paid to employees who were not working during a quarter because the business suspended operations or had a significant decline in gross receipts. These employers can only count wages up to the amount that the employee would have been paid for working an equivalent duration during the 30 days immediately preceding the period of economic hardship.\nI got PPP funds already. Can I also get ERTC?\nInitially with the CARES Act, employers could choose to apply for PPP or claim ERTC credits, but not both.\nPPP was more beneficial than ERTC for most businesses (for reasons we won’t go into here) and so most businesses with under 500 employees received forgivable PPP Loans.\nOn March 11, 2021, The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law and included many modifications and expansions to existing elements of previous stimulus programs.\nNoteworthy modifications for business owners included:\nBusinesses who applied for and received PPP funds could now also claim ERTC credits.\nERTC credits could be retroactively claimed for businesses that qualified in 2020.\nERTC credits were extended through 9/30/21 with lower qualification requirements.\nThe per-employee cap on qualifying wages increased from $10,000 for all of 2020 to $10,000 per quarter for the first 3 quarters of 2021.\nThe refundable credit amount increased from 50% of qualifying wages in 2020 to 70% in 2021.\nSo the short answer is “Yes” . . . you can claim ERTC even if you received PPP funds.\nHow do I apply for ERTC tax credits?\nUnlike the Payroll Protection Program (administered by the Small Business Administration), there is actually no “application process” for the Employee Retention Tax Credits.\nYou simply claim the ERTC tax credit like you would any other tax credit – by asserting to the IRS that you can legally claim the credit.\nWhen you claim a child tax credit, you do so by asserting this fact on your Form 1020 Personal Income Tax Return.\nThe difference is that when you claim an ERTC tax credit, you do so on your Form 941 Employer Quarterly Tax Filing.\nFor prior quarters, you must file an amended form (the Form 941-X) to reduce your current quarter’s tax contribution and request a refund of excess credits (which is highly likely).\nAnother perk of ERTC, is that since you can often estimate these credits in advance of distributing cash for payroll, you can file a Form 7200 to receive a cash advance to avoid waiting until the end of the quarter to apply for the refund.\nMy revenue in Q1 2021 is back to pre-pandemic levels - so I must be ineligible - right?\nEven though you may feel like revenue is back to normal, there are some items you want to consider before passing on this ERTC assessment.\nFirst, even if revenues have returned to “normal” in 2021, you may have qualified in 2020 and you can retroactively claim those credits. That eligibility criteria in 2020 was based on revenue declines from 2019, or if your business was partially or fully closed due to governmental mandate.\nSecond, while your revenue may have returned to “normal” in Q1 2021, remember that we are comparing your Q1 2021 to Q1 2019. If 2019 was a year of growth for your business, then your revenue levels 2 years ago may have been much less than Q1 2020.\nAnd lastly, if your revenues were down in Q4 2020 by just 20% compared to Q4 2019, then you may also be eligible for Q1 2021. There is a safe harbor provision that few advisors are talking about, and it means that many businesses are qualifying for $7,000 per employee in Q1 2021.\nI know, it seems too good to be true, but the government wants to incentivize and reward you for keeping US residents employed and money flowing through our economy as we rebuild bigger and stronger than before.\nI thought payroll taxes deferred in 2020 had to be re-paid. Does ERTC work the same way?\nYou are most likely referring to a provision of the CARES Act that allowed employers to defer the deposit and payment of the employer’s share of Social Security taxes. Those deferrals must then be repaid – with at least 50% of the balance due by 12/31/21 and the remaining balance due by 12/31/22.\nERTC credits are NOT a deferral. They are dollar-for-dollar credits against wages you’ve paid. Not taxes you’ve paid, but actual wages.\nThese credits can offset future tax contributions or you can receive a refund check – it’s your choice.\nAnd you will NOT have to re-pay these funds (unless, of course, you don’t provide adequate documentation in the course of an audit).\nWhy isn't my bank talking about this?\nYour banker was probably very helpful when it came to getting your PPP funds because they were effectively signing you to an SBA-guaranteed loan. The SBA paid the bank administrative fees based on the PPP loans they made, and so they were incentivized to educate you about the program and get all your paperwork in order.\nCompared to the ERTC, the PPP program was also a rather simple calculation. 2 ½ times your average monthly payroll including health insurance and state unemployment taxes.\nFrom the conversations we’ve had with bankers, they have no interest in involving themselves in your employment tax compliance. For them it is a liability and beyond their scope of services.\nWill my Tax CPA handle this for me since they handle my income tax returns?\nWhether your tax accountant is a CPA or EA, he or she most likely only prepares your Federal and State Income Tax Returns. However, ERTC credits are claimed against Employment Taxes on Form 941, and cash advanced through Form 7200.\nThe complexity of the ERTC program is a beast unto itself and every tax accountant we’ve talked to has said they focus on staying up-to-date on the ever-evolving income tax code, and they can’t now become experts in the ERTC program as well.\nIf your tax accountant is comfortable determining your eligibility by quarter and year, computing your credits, and preparing contemporaneous documentation to support an IRS audit, then you should certainly let them handle all of this.\nIf you want a second set of eyes on this, we’re happy to take a look.\nWhat about my Payroll Service Provider? Shouldn't they be on top of this?\nYour Payroll Service does an excellent job of executing the fundamentals of paying your employees, paying your employment taxes and filing your quarterly reports.\nBut computing your ERTC credits requires visibility into your P&L and PPP forgiveness applications. Not only that, but the complex requirements around eligibility and allocating ERTC credits at the employee-level while accounting for annual and quarterly qualifying wage gaps and . . . well, you can probably tell why Payroll Services are not offering to do all of this for you.\nThe Payroll Services that we’ve worked with so far are happy to provide the payroll registers that we need to perform the allocations. And they are happy to file the Amended Form 941-X with the IRS on our client’s behalf.\nBut that’s the extent of it.\nIn fact, most wise Payroll Services are asking clients to sign an indemnification waiver before submitting a Form 941-X because the Payroll Service can take no responsibility for the accuracy of the ERTC credits you are claiming.\nFor them to involve themselves in the intricacies of this calculation, it is a liability and beyond their scope of services.\nWhy did the IRS issue a warning about 3rd party processing companies?\nThe IRS issued these warnings, as there are many fly-by-night, so-called ERC “experts” or “consultants” that are misrepresenting their experiences and the parameters of the ERC program to employers. The ERC is a complicated tax program that requires deep expertise and understand of the nuances. When choosing an ERC company look for companies with a proven real track record and watch out for red flags (e..g, large upfront cost, no CPAs or tax professionals on staff)\nHow long does the IRS have to audit my ERC?\n“The IRS Audit period for ERC is:\n3 years for 2020 and Q1,Q2 of 2021\n5 years for Q3 of 2021 “\nAre there any restrictions on how I can spend my ERC refund?\nUnlike a loan or other form of business funding, the Employee Retention Credit (ERC) is a fully refundable tax credit that does not come with limitations on how it can be spent. As a result, businesses that qualify for the ERC can choose to spend their refund in any way they see fit."

      "main_content": "COVID-19-Related Employee Retention Credits: Determining When an Employer is Considered to have a Significant Decline in Gross Receipts and Maximum Amount of an Eligible Employer’s Employee Retention Credit FAQs\n39. How is the significant decline in gross receipts calculated?\nA significant decline in gross receipts is calculated by determining the first calendar quarter in 2020 (if any) in which an employer’s gross receipts are less than 50 percent of its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019. If the gross receipts decline to that extent, the employer also must later determine if there is a later calendar quarter in 2020 in which the employer’s 2020 quarterly gross receipts are greater than 80 percent of its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019. If so, the significant decline in gross receipts ends with the first calendar quarter that follows the first calendar quarter in which the employer’s 2020 quarterly gross receipts are greater than 80 percent of its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019, or with the first calendar quarter of 2021.\nExample: Employer I’s gross receipts were $100,000, $190,000, and $230,000 in the first, second, and third calendar quarters of 2020, respectively. Its gross receipts were $210,000, $230,000, and $250,000 in the first, second, and third calendar quarters of 2019, respectively. Thus, Employer I’s 2020 first, second, and third quarter gross receipts were approximately 48 percent, 83 percent, and 92 percent of its 2019 first, second, and third quarter gross receipts, respectively. Accordingly, Employer I had a significant decline in gross receipts commencing on the first day of the first calendar quarter of 2020 (the calendar quarter in which gross receipts were less than 50 percent of the same quarter in 2019) and ending on the first day of the third calendar quarter of 2020 (the quarter following the quarter for which the gross receipts were more than 80 percent of the same quarter in 2019). Thus, Employer I is entitled to a retention credit with respect to the first and second calendar quarters.\n40. What are \"gross receipts\" for an employer other than a tax-exempt organization?\n“Gross receipts” for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit for an employer other than a tax-exempt organization has the same meaning as when used under section 448(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). Under the section 448(c) regulations, “gross receipts” means gross receipts of the taxable year and generally includes total sales (net of returns and allowances) and all amounts received for services. In addition, gross receipts include any income from investments, and from incidental or outside sources. For example, gross receipts include interest (including original issue discount and tax-exempt interest within the meaning of section 103 of the Code), dividends, rents, royalties, and annuities, regardless of whether such amounts are derived in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s trade or business. Gross receipts are generally not reduced by cost of goods sold, but are generally reduced by the taxpayer’s adjusted basis in capital assets sold. Gross receipts do not include the repayment of a loan, or amounts received with respect to sales tax if the tax is legally imposed on the purchaser of the good or service, and the taxpayer merely collects and remits the sales tax to the taxing authority.\n41. Does an employer need to prove that a significant decline in gross receipts is related to COVID-19?\nNo. The CARES Act does not require that the significant decline in gross receipts be related to COVID-19. However, employers should keep records for the relevant calendar quarters in 2019 and 2020 to document the significant decline in gross receipts. The records should be available for IRS review for at least four years.\n42. If an Eligible Employer does not determine that it had a significant decline in gross receipts in 2020 until after January 1, 2021, may it still be eligible for the Employee Retention Credit on qualified wages paid in 2020?\nYes. The employer may claim the Employee Retention Credit on qualified wages paid in 2020 if it determines that a significant decline in gross receipts occurred in 2020 even if it does not make the determination until after January 1, 2021. In this case, the employer may claim the credit by filing the appropriate form to report adjustments to its employment taxes, typically Form 941-X, Adjusted Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund.\nFor more information on correcting employment taxes, see Correcting Employment Taxes.\n43. For an aggregated group, is the significant decline in gross receipts test determined based on the entire group?\nYes. All entities are considered a single employer for purposes of determining whether the employer had a significant decline in gross receipts if they are aggregated as a controlled group of corporations under section 52(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”); are partnerships, trusts or sole proprietorships under common control under section 52(b) of the Code; or are entities that are aggregated under section 414(m) or (o) of the Code. For more information, see Determining Which Entities are Considered a Single Employer Under the Aggregation Rules.\nTo be an Eligible Employer on the basis of a significant decline of gross receipts, the employer must take into account the gross receipts of all members of the aggregated group. If the aggregated group does not experience a significant decline in gross receipts, then no member of the group may claim the Employee Retention Credit on that basis.\nExample: Employer J and Employer K are members of a section 52(a) controlled group of corporations. Neither Employer J nor Employer K is subject to a governmental order suspending business operations, and neither received a Paycheck Protection Program loan. Employer J has gross receipts of $1,000,000 in the second quarter of 2019 and $400,000 in the second quarter of 2020. Employer K has gross receipts of $1,000,000 in second quarter of 2019 and $750,000 in second quarter of 2020. Although Employer J’s gross receipts in the second quarter of 2020 were 40 percent of its 2019 second quarter gross receipts, neither Employer J nor Employer K can claim the Employee Retention Credit under the gross receipts test. Employers J and K had combined gross receipts of $2,000,000 in the second quarter of 2019 and $1,150,000 in the second quarter of 2020. Their combined gross receipts for the second quarter of 2020 would have had to be less than $1,000,000 (50 percent of $2,000,000) for Employers J and K to have experienced a significant decline in gross receipts for the second quarter of 2020.\n44. How does an employer that started a business in 2019 determine whether it had a significant decline in gross receipts for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?\nAn employer that started a business in the first quarter of 2019 should use the gross receipts for the applicable quarter of 2019 for comparison to the gross receipts for the same quarter in 2020 to determine whether it experienced a significant decline in gross receipts in any quarter of 2020.\nAn employer that started a business in the second quarter of 2019 should use that quarter as the base period to determine whether it experienced a significant decline in gross receipts for the first two quarters in 2020 and should use the third and fourth quarters of 2019 for comparison to the third and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively, to determine whether it experienced a significant decline in gross receipts for those quarters.\nAn employer that started a business in the third quarter of 2019 should use that quarter as the base period to determine whether it experienced a significant decline in gross receipts for the first three quarters in 2020 and should use the fourth quarter of 2019 for comparison to the fourth quarter of 2020 to determine whether it experienced a significant decline in gross receipts for that quarter\nAn employer that started a business in the fourth quarter of 2019 should use that quarter as the base period to determine whether it had a significant decline in gross receipts for any quarter in 2020.\nIf the employer commenced business in the middle of a quarter in 2019, the employer should estimate the gross receipts it would have had for the entire quarter based on the gross receipts for the portion of the quarter that the business was in operation.\n45. How does an employer that acquires a trade or business during the 2020 calendar year determine if the employer had a significant decline in gross receipts?\nFor purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, to determine whether an employer has a significant decline in gross receipts, an employer that acquires (in an asset purchase, stock purchase, or any other form of acquisition) a trade or business during 2020 (an “acquired business”) is required to include the gross receipts from the acquired business in its gross receipts computation for each calendar quarter that it owns and operates the acquired business. Solely for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, when an employer compares its gross receipts for a 2020 calendar quarter when it owns an acquired business to its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019, the employer may, to the extent the information is available, include the gross receipts of the acquired business in its gross receipts for the 2019 calendar quarter. Under this safe harbor approach, the employer may include these gross receipts regardless of the fact that the employer did not own the acquired business during that 2019 calendar quarter.\nAn employer that acquires a trade or business in the middle of a calendar quarter in 2020 and that chooses to use this safe harbor approach must estimate the gross receipts it would have had from that acquired business for the entire quarter based on the gross receipts for the portion of the quarter that it owned and operated the acquired business. However, an employer that chooses not to use this safe harbor approach is only required to include the gross receipts from the acquired business for the portion of the quarter that it owned and operated the acquired business.\nExample: Employer L acquired all of the assets of a trade or business in a taxable transaction on January 1, 2020. The gross receipts of the acquired business were $50,000 for the quarter beginning January 1, 2020 and ending March 31, 2020 and $200,000 for the quarter beginning January 1, 2019 and ending March 31, 2019. Employer L has access to the books and records from the prior owner of the acquired trade or business and can determine the amount of gross receipts attributable to the trade or business for the quarter beginning January 1, 2019 and ending March 31, 2019. For purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, Employer L must include $50,000 in its gross receipts computation for the quarter beginning January 1, 2020 and ending March 31, 2020 (Employer L actually owned the trade or business) and may include $200,000 in its gross receipts computation for the quarter beginning January 1, 2019 and ending March 31, 2019.\n46. What are \"gross receipts\" for a tax-exempt employer? (updated June 19, 2020)\nSolely for purposes of determining eligibility for the Employee Retention Credit, gross receipts for a tax-exempt employer include gross receipts from all operations, not only from activities that constitute unrelated trades or businesses. For example, gross receipts for this purpose include amounts received by the organization from total sales (net of returns and allowances) and all amounts received for services, whether or not those sales or services are substantially related to the organization’s exercise or performance of the exempt purpose or function constituting the basis for its exemption. Gross receipts also include the organization’s investment income, including from dividends, rents, and royalties, as well as the gross amount received as contributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts, and the gross amount received as dues or assessments from members or affiliated organizations.\nTo determine whether there has been a significant decline in gross receipts, a tax-exempt employer computes its gross receipts received from all of its operations during the calendar quarter and compares those gross receipts to the same gross receipts received for the same calendar quarter in 2019.\n47. How is the maximum amount of the Employee Retention Credit available to Eligible Employers determined?\nThe credit equals 50 percent of the qualified wages (including qualified health plan expenses) that an Eligible Employer pays in a calendar quarter. The maximum amount of qualified wages taken into account with respect to each employee for all calendar quarters is $10,000, so that the maximum credit for qualified wages paid to any employee is $5,000.\nExample 1: Employer M pays $10,000 in qualified wages to Employee A in the second quarter of 2020. The Employee Retention Credit available to Employer M for the qualified wages paid to Employee A is $5,000.\nExample 2: Employer N pays $8,000 in qualified wages to Employee B in the second quarter 2020 and $8,000 in qualified wages in the third quarter 2020. The credit available to Employer N for the qualified wages paid to Employee B is equal to $4,000 in the second quarter and $1,000 in the third quarter due to the overall limit of 50 percent of $10,000 of qualified wages per employee for all calendar quarters."

      "main_content": "COVID-19-Related Employee Retention Credits: Determining When an Employer’s Trade or Business Operations are Considered to be Fully or Partially Suspended Due to a Governmental Order FAQs\n30. If a governmental order requires non-essential businesses to suspend operations but allows essential businesses to continue operations, is the essential business considered to have a full or partial suspension of operations? (updated June 19, 2020)\nAn employer that operates an essential business is not considered to have a full or partial suspension of operations if the governmental order allows the employer’s operations to remain open. However, an employer that operates an essential business may be considered to have a partial suspension of operations if, under the facts and circumstances, more than a nominal portion of its business operations are suspended by a governmental order. For example, an employer that maintains both essential and non-essential business operations, each of which are more than nominal portions of the business operations, may be considered to have a partial suspension of its operations if a governmental order restricts the operations of the non-essential portion of the business, even if the essential portion of the business is unaffected. In addition, an essential business that is permitted to continue its operations may, nonetheless, be considered to have a partial suspension of its operations if a governmental order requires the business to close for a period of time during normal working hours.\nFor more information regarding employers whose business operations may continue for certain purposes, but not others, see “ If a governmental order causes the suppliers to an essential business to suspend their operations, is the essential business considered to have a suspension of operations? “\nFor more information regarding the application of the full and partial suspension rules if the essential business’ suppliers are required to close due to a governmental order, see “ If a governmental order causes the suppliers to an essential business to suspend their operations, is the essential business considered to have a suspension of operations? “\nFor more information regarding the application of the full and partial suspension rules if the essential business’s operating hours are affected by a governmental order, see Are an employer’s operations considered to be partially suspended for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit if the employer is required to reduce its operating hours by a governmental order?\nEven if an employer’s operations are not considered to have been fully or partially suspended as a consequence of a governmental order, the employer may be considered an Eligible Employer and may be eligible for the Employee Retention Credit if it experiences a significant decline in gross receipts. For more information on what constitutes a significant decline in gross receipts, see Determining When an Employer is Considered to have a Significant Decline in Gross Receipts.\n31. If a governmental order causes the suppliers to an essential business to suspend their operations, is the essential business considered to have a suspension of operations?\nAn employer with an essential business may be considered to have a full or partial suspension of operations if the business’s suppliers are unable to make deliveries of critical goods or materials due to a governmental order that causes the supplier to suspend its operations. If the facts and circumstances indicate that the essential business’s operations are fully or partially suspended as a result of the inability to obtain critical goods or materials from its suppliers that were required to suspend operations, then the essential business would be considered an Eligible Employer and may be eligible to receive the Employee Retention Credit.\nAlternatively, the employer may be an Eligible Employer if it experiences a significant decline in gross receipts. For more information on what constitutes a significant decline in gross receipts, see Determining When an Employer is Considered to have a Significant Decline in Gross Receipts.\nExample: Employer A operates an auto parts manufacturing business that is considered an essential trade or business in the jurisdiction where it operates. Employer A’s supplier of raw materials is required to shut down its operations due to a governmental order. Employer A is unable to procure these raw materials from an alternate supplier. As a consequence of the suspension of Employer A’s supplier, Employer A is not able to perform its operations. Under these facts and circumstances, Employer A would be considered an Eligible Employer because its operations have been suspended as a result of the governmental order that suspended operations of its supplier.\n32. If a governmental order causes the customers of an essential business to stay at home is the essential business considered to have a suspension of operations?\nNo. An employer that operates an essential business that is not required to close its physical locations or otherwise suspend its operations is not considered to have a full or partial suspension of its operations for the sole reason that its customers are subject to a government order requiring them to stay at home.\nThe employer may be considered an Eligible Employer and may be eligible for the Employee Retention Credit if it experiences a significant decline in gross receipts. For more information on what constitutes a significant decline in gross receipts, see Determining When an Employer is Considered to have a Significant Decline in Gross Receipts.\nExample: Employer B, an automobile repair service business, is an essential business and is not required to close its locations or suspend its operations. Due to a governmental order that limits travel and requires members of the community to stay at home except for certain essential travel, such as going to the grocery store, Employer B’s business has declined significantly. Employer B is not considered to have a full or partial suspension of operations due to a governmental order. However, Employer B may be considered an Eligible Employer if it has a significant decline in gross receipts.\n33. If a governmental order requires an employer to close its workplace, but the employer is able to continue operations comparable to its operations prior to the closure by requiring employees to telework, is the employer considered to have a suspension of operations? (updated June 19, 2020)\nIf an employer’s workplace is closed by a governmental order, but the employer is able to continue operations comparable to its operations prior to the closure by requiring its employees to telework, the employer’s operations are not considered to have been fully or partially suspended as a consequence of a governmental order.\nHowever, if the closure of the workplace causes the employer to suspend business operations for certain purposes, but not others, it may be considered to have a partial suspension of operations due to the governmental order. For more information regarding employers whose business operations may continue for certain purposes, but not others, see “ If a governmental order requires an employer to close its workplace for certain purposes, but the workplace may remain operational for limited purposes, is the employer considered to have a suspension of operations? ”\nEven if an employer’s operations are not considered to have been fully or partially suspended as a consequence of a governmental order, the employer may be considered an Eligible Employer and may be eligible for the Employee Retention Credit if it experiences a significant decline in gross receipts. For more information on what constitutes a significant decline in gross receipts, see Determining When an Employer is Considered to have a Significant Decline in Gross Receipts.\nExample 1: Employer C, a software development company maintains an office in a city where the mayor has ordered that only essential businesses may operate. Employer C’s business is not essential under the mayor’s order which requires Employer C to close its office. Prior to the governmental order, all employees at the company teleworked once or twice per week, and business meetings were held at various locations. Following the governmental order, the company ordered mandatory telework for all employees and limited client meetings to telephone or video conferences. Employer C’s business operations are not considered to be fully or partially suspended by the governmental order because its business operations may continue in a comparable manner.\nExample 2: Employer D operates a physical therapy facility in a city where the mayor has ordered that only essential businesses may operate. Employer D’s business is not considered essential under the mayor’s order, which requires Employer D to close its workplace. Prior to the governmental order, none of Employer D’s employees provided services through telework and all appointments, administration, and other duties were carried out at Employer D’s workplace. Following the governmental order, Employer D moves to an online format and is able to serve some clients remotely, but employees cannot access specific equipment or tools that they typically use in therapy and not all clients can be served remotely. Employer D’s business operations are considered to be partially suspended by the governmental order because Employer D’s workplace, including access to physical therapy equipment, is central to its operations, and the business operations cannot continue in a comparable manner.\nExample 3: Employer E, a scientific research company with facilities in a state in which the governor has ordered that only essential businesses may operate, conducts research in a laboratory setting and through the use of computer modeling. Employer E’s business is not essential under the governor’s order, which requires Employer E to close its workplace. Prior to the governmental order, Employer E’s laboratory-based research operations could not be conducted remotely (other than certain related administrative tasks) and employees involved in laboratory-based research worked on-site; however, Employer E’s computer modeling research operations could be conducted remotely and employees engaged in this portion of the business often teleworked. Following the governmental order, all employees engaged in computer modeling research are directed to telework, and those business operations are able to continue in a comparable manner. In contrast, the employees engaged in the laboratory-based research cannot perform their work while the facility is closed and are limited to performing administrative tasks during the closure. Employer E’s business operations are considered to be partially suspended by the governmental order because Employer E’s laboratory-based research business operations cannot continue in a comparable manner.\n34. If a governmental order requires an employer to close its workplace for certain purposes, but the workplace may remain operational for limited purposes, is the employer considered to have a suspension of operations? (updated June 19, 2020)\nYes. If an employer’s workplace is closed by a governmental order for certain purposes, but the employer’s workplace may remain open for other purposes or the employer is able to continue certain operations remotely, the employer’s operations would be considered to be partially suspended. However, if all of an employer’s business operations may continue, even if subject to modification (for example, to satisfy distancing requirements), such a modification of operations is not considered to be a partial suspension of business operations due to a governmental order, unless the modification required by the governmental order has more than a nominal effect on the business operations under the facts and circumstances.\nExample 1: Employer F, a restaurant business, must close its restaurant to on-site dining due to a governmental order closing all restaurants, bars, and similar establishments for sit-down service. Employer F is allowed to continue food or beverage sales to the public on a carry-out, drive-through, or delivery basis. Employer F’s business operations are considered to be partially suspended because a portion of its business operations – its indoor and outdoor dining service – is closed due to the governmental order.\nExample 2: Same facts as Example 1, except that two months later, under a subsequent governmental order, Employer F is permitted to offer sit-down service in its outdoor space, but its indoor dining service continues to be closed. During the period in which Employer F is allowed to operate only its outdoor sit-down and carry-out service in accordance with the order, Employer F’s business operations are considered to be partially suspended because, under the facts and circumstances, a more than nominal portion of its business operations – its indoor dining service — is closed due to a governmental order. The following month, under a further governmental order, Employer F is permitted to offer indoor dining service, in addition to outdoor sit-down and carry-out service, provided that all tables in the indoor dining room must be spaced at least six feet apart. Under the facts and circumstances, the governmental order restricting the spacing of tables limits Employer F’s indoor dining service capacity and has more than a nominal effect on its business operations. During this period, Employer F’s business operations continue to be considered to be partially suspended because the governmental order restricting its indoor dining service has more than a nominal effect on its operations.\nExample 3: Employer G, a retail business, must close its retail storefront locations due to a governmental order. The retail business also maintains a website through which it continues to fulfill online orders; the retailer’s online ordering and fulfillment system is unaffected by the governmental order. Employer G’s business operations are considered to have been partially suspended due to the governmental order requiring it to close its retail store locations.\nExample 4: Employer H, a hospital, is considered to be operating an essential business under a governmental order with respect to its emergency department, intensive care, and other services for conditions requiring urgent medical care. However, the governmental order treats Employer H’s elective and non-urgent medical procedures as non-essential business operations and prevents Employer H from performing these services. Employer H suspends operations related to elective and non-urgent medical procedures. Although Employer H is an essential business, Employer H is considered to have a partial suspension of operations due to the governmental order that prevents Employer H from performing elective and non-urgent medical procedures\nExample 5: Employer I, a grocery store, is considered to be operating an essential business under a governmental order. However, the governmental order requires grocery stores to discontinue their self-serve offerings, such as salad bars, though they may offer prepared or prepackaged food. Employer I modifies its operations to close its salad bar and other self-serve offerings and instead offers prepackaged salads and other items. The governmental order requiring Employer I to discontinue its self-serve offerings does not have more than a nominal effect on Employer I’s business operations under the facts and circumstances, even though Employer I was required to modify its business operations. Employer I’s business operations are not considered to be partially suspended because the governmental order requiring closure of self-serve offerings does not have more than a nominal effect on its business operations.\nExample 6: Employer J, a large retailer, is required to close its storefront location due to a governmental order, but is permitted to provide customers with curbside service to pick up items ordered online or by phone. During this period, Employer J’s business operations are considered to have been partially suspended due to the governmental order requiring it to close its storefront location. Two months later, under a subsequent governmental order, Employer J is permitted to reopen its storefront location. Under the subsequent governmental order, however, Employer J must enforce social distancing guidelines that require Employer J to admit only a specified number of customers into the store per 1,000 square feet. While the governmental order results in customers waiting in line for a short period of time to enter the store during certain busy times of the week, the size of Employer J’s storefront location is large enough that it is able to accommodate all of its customers after these short waits outside the store. The governmental order requiring Employer J to enforce social distancing guidelines does not have more than a nominal effect on Employer J’s business operations under the facts and circumstances, even though Employer J is required to modify its business operations. During this period, Employer J’s business operations are not considered to be partially suspended because the governmental order requiring enforcement of social distancing guidelines does not have more than a nominal effect on its operations.\n35. Are an employer's operations considered to be partially suspended for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit if the employer is required to reduce its operating hours by a governmental order? (updated June 19, 2020)\nYes. An employer that reduces its operating hours due to a governmental order is considered to have partially suspended its operations since the employer’s operations have been limited by a governmental order.\nThe employer may also be an Eligible Employer if it experiences a significant decline in gross receipts. For more information on what constitutes a significant decline in gross receipts, see Determining When an Employer is Considered to have a Significant Decline in Gross Receipts.\nExample: Employer K operates a food processing facility that normally operates 24 hours a day. A governmental order issued by the local health department requires all food processing businesses to deep clean their workplaces once every 24 hours in order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure. In order to comply with the governmental order, Employer K reduces its daily operating hours by five hours per day so that a deep cleaning may be conducted within its workplace once every 24 hours. Employer K is considered to have partially suspended its operations due to the governmental order requiring it to reduce its hours of operation.\n36. Is an employer that operates a trade or business in multiple locations and is subject to a governmental order requiring full or partial suspension of its operations in some jurisdictions, but not in others, considered to have a suspension of operations?\nYes. Employers that operate a trade or business in multiple locations and are subject to State and local governmental orders limiting operations in some, but not all, jurisdictions are considered to have a partial suspension of operations. Employers that operate a trade or business on a national or regional basis may be subject to governmental orders requiring closure of their locations in certain jurisdictions, but may not be subject to such a governmental order in other jurisdictions, including because it may be an essential business in some of those jurisdictions. To operate in a consistent manner in all jurisdictions, these employers may establish a policy that complies with the local governmental orders, as well as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) guidance; in this case, even though the employer may not be subject to a governmental order to suspend operations of its trade or business in certain jurisdictions, and may merely be following CDC or DHS guidelines in those jurisdictions, the employer would still be considered to have partially suspended operations. Therefore, the employer would be an Eligible Employer with respect to all of its operations in all locations. For more information regarding the application of the aggregation rules, see If the operations of a trade or business of one member of an aggregated group are suspended by a governmental order, are the operations of that trade or business of the other members of the aggregated group considered to be fully or partially suspended for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?\nExample: Employer F is a national retail store chain with operations in every state in the United States. In some jurisdictions, Employer F is subject to a governmental order to close its stores, but it is permitted to provide customers with curbside service to pick up items ordered online or by phone. In other jurisdictions, Employer F is not subject to any governmental order to close its stores or is considered an essential business permitting its stores to remain open. Employer F establishes a company-wide policy, in compliance with the local governmental orders and consistent with the CDC and DHS recommendations and guidance, requiring the closure of all stores and operating with curbside pick-up only, even in those jurisdictions where the business was not subject to a governmental order. As a result of the governmental orders requiring closure of Employer F’s stores in certain jurisdictions, Employer F has a partial suspension of operations of its trade or business. The partial suspension results in Employer F being an Eligible Employer nationwide.\nThe employer may also be an Eligible Employer if it experiences a significant decline in gross receipts. For more information on what constitutes a significant decline in gross receipts, see Determining When an Employer is Considered to have a Significant Decline in Gross Receipts.\n37. If the operations of a trade or business of one member of an aggregated group are suspended by a governmental order, are the operations of that trade or business of the other members of the aggregated group considered to be fully or partially suspended for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?\nYes. All members of an aggregated group are treated as a single employer for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. Accordingly, if a trade or business is operated by multiple members of an aggregated group and if the operations of one member of the aggregated group are suspended by a governmental order, then all members of the aggregated group are considered to have their operations partially suspended, even if another member of the group is in a jurisdiction that is not subject to a governmental order.\nExample: Employer Group G is a restaurant chain that operates a single trade or business through multiple subsidiary corporations located in various jurisdictions. Certain members of Employer Group G’s operations are closed by a governmental order, while other members of Employer Group G’s operations remain open. As a result of a governmental order causing the suspension of operations of certain of Employer Group G members, the operations of all members of Employer Group G’s controlled group of corporations are treated as partially suspended due to the governmental order.\nFor more information on the aggregation rules, see Determining Which Entities are Considered a Single Employer Under the Aggregation Rules.\nAlternatively, the employer may be an Eligible Employer if the aggregated group experiences a significant decline in gross receipts. For more information on what constitutes a significant decline in gross receipts, see Determining When an Employer is Considered to have a Significant Decline in Gross Receipts.\n38. If an employer is subject to a governmental order to fully or partially suspend its business operations and the order is subsequently lifted, is the employer considered to have business operations that were suspended?\nYes, but only for periods during the calendar quarters in which the trade or business operations were fully or partially suspended. If the order was effective for a portion of the calendar quarter, then the employer is an Eligible Employer for the entire calendar quarter but can only claim a credit for wages paid during the period the order is in force.\nExample: State Y issued a governmental order for all non-essential businesses to close from March 10 through April 30 and the governmental order was not extended. Pursuant to the order, Employer H, which operates a non-essential business in State Y, closes from March 10 through April 30. Employer H is an Eligible Employer in the first quarter (for wages paid from March 13, the effective date of section 2301 of the CARES Act, through March 31) and the second quarter (for wages paid from April 1 through April 30)."

Which related employers are aggregated and treated as a single employer for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?\nFor purposes of determining an employer’s eligibility for and the amount of the Employee Retention Credit, all entities that are treated as a single employer under section 52(a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) or section 414(m) or (o) of the Code are considered one employer for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. The section 52(a) and (b) aggregation rules generally apply to determine when related entities are treated as a single employer for purposes of the application of tax credits available to an employer under section 51 of the Code, as well as for other Code provisions. The section 414(m) and (o) rules generally apply to determine when related entities, including affiliated service groups, are treated as a single employer for purposes of retirement and other employee benefit rules under the Code, as well as for other Code provisions.\nUnder the section 52 rules, corporate taxpayers may be required to aggregate as a parent-subsidiary controlled group, a brother-sister controlled group, or a combined group of corporations. Section 52(a) of the Code describes a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations, generally, as one or more chains of corporations where the common parent corporation owns more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or more than 50 percent of the value of all classes of stock of each corporation. A brother-sister controlled group of corporations, generally, is two or more corporations where: (1) five or fewer persons who are individuals, estates, or trusts own at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation; and (2) the same five or fewer persons, taking into account ownership only to the extent that it is identical with respect to each corporation, own more than 50 percent of the total voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation. A combined group of corporations is three or more corporations, each of which is a member of either a parent-subsidiary or a brother-sister controlled group, and at least one of which is both the common parent of a parent-subsidiary controlled group and also a member of a brother-sister controlled group.\nThe section 52(b) aggregation rules apply to partnerships, trusts, estates, or sole proprietorships in trades or businesses under common control. Under this rule, entities are considered a single employer if they are under common control applying rules similar to the parent-subsidiary or brother-sister controlled group rules or the rules for a combined group of corporations.\nUnder section 414(m) of the Code, an “affiliated service group” is treated as a single employer based on rules related to the performance of services by one entity for another or by one entity in association with another for third parties, even if the entity does not have sufficient ownership or control of the other entity to form a controlled group.\n26. What is the impact of the aggregations rules that treat related entities as a single employer?\nAll entities that are members of a controlled group of corporations or a group of entities under common control under section 52(a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) rules, members of an affiliated service group under section 414(m) of the Code, or otherwise aggregated under section 414(o) of the Code are considered a single employer for purposes of the application of the Employee Retention Credit rules. As a result, these employers must be aggregated for purposes of the following rules applicable to the Employee Retention Credit:\nDetermining whether the employer has a trade or business operation that was fully or partially suspended due to orders related to COVID-19 from an appropriate governmental authority. For more information, see Determining When an Employer’s Trade or Business Operations are Considered to be Fully or Partially Suspended Due to a Governmental Order.\nDetermining whether the employer has a significant decline in gross receipts. For more information, see Determining When an Employer is Considered to have a Significant Decline in Gross Receipts.\nDetermining whether the employer has more than 100 full-time employees. For more information, see Does an Eligible Employer identify the average number of full-time employees based on the aggregation rule?\nThe application of the rules that preclude an employer from claiming the Employee Retention Credit if any member of the aggregated group received a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan under the Small Business Act. For more information, see Interaction with Other Credit and Relief Provisions.\n27. How is the Employee Retention Credit allocated to an Eligible Employer that is a member of an aggregated group? The amount of the Employee Retention Credit must be apportioned among members of the aggregated group on the basis of each member's proportionate share of the qualified wages giving rise to the credit.\nNo. The Federal government, the governments of any State or political subdivision thereof, and any agency or instrumentality of those governments are not Eligible Employers and are not entitled to receive the Employee Retention Credit. However, tribal governments and tribal entities may be Eligible Employers. See Are tribal governments and tribal entities eligible for the Employee Retention Credit?"

      "main_content": "COVID-19-Related Employee Retention Credits: Determining What Types of Governmental Orders May be Taken into Account for Purposes of the Employee Retention Credit FAQs\n28. What \"orders from an appropriate governmental authority\" may be taken into account for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit? (updated June 19, 2020)\nOrders, proclamations, or decrees from the Federal government, or any State or local government are considered “orders from an appropriate governmental authority” if they limit commerce, travel, or group meetings due to COVID-19 in a manner that affects an employer’s operation of its trade or business, including orders that limit hours of operation and, if they are from a State or local government, they are from a State or local government that has jurisdiction over the employer’s operations (referred to as a “governmental order”).\nStatements from a governmental official, including comments made during press conferences or in interviews with the media, do not rise to the level of a governmental order for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. Additionally, the declaration of a state of emergency by a governmental authority is not sufficient to rise to the level of a governmental order if it does not limit commerce, travel, or group meetings in any manner. Further, such a declaration that limits commerce, travel, or group meetings, but does so in a manner that does not affect the employer’s operation of its trade or business does not rise to the level of a governmental order.\nA governmental order allows employers to qualify as Eligible Employers for purposes of claiming the Employee Retention Credit without regard to the level of enforcement of the governmental order.\nGovernmental orders include:\nAn order from the city’s mayor stating that all non-essential businesses must close for a specified period;\nA State’s emergency proclamation that residents must shelter in place for a specified period, other than residents who are employed by an essential business and who may travel to and work at the workplace location;\nAn order from a local official imposing a curfew on residents that impacts the operating hours of a trade or business for a specified period;\nAn order from a local health department mandating a workplace closure for cleaning and disinfecting.\nWhether the operations of a trade or business are considered essential or non-essential will often vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. An employer should determine whether it is an essential or non-essential business by referring to the governmental order affecting the employer’s operation of its trade or business. For more information on when a business’s operations are considered to be fully or partially suspended due to a governmental order, see “Determining When an Employer’s Trade or Business Operations are Considered to be Fully or Partially Suspended Due to a Governmental Order.”\nExample 1: Governor of State Y issues an order that all non-essential businesses must close from March 20, 2020 until April 30, 2020. The order provides a list of non-essential businesses, including gyms, spas, nightclubs, barber shops, hair salons, tattoo parlors, physical therapy offices, waxing salons, fitness centers, bowling alleys, arcades, racetracks, indoor children’s play areas, theaters, chiropractors, planetariums, museums, and performing arts centers. Employers that provide essential services may remain open. The governor’s order is a governmental order limiting the operations of non-essential businesses, entitling employers with non-essential businesses to claim the Employee Retention Credit for qualified wages.\nExample 2: Mayor of City Y holds a press conference in which she encourages residents to practice social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The statement during the press conference is not an order limiting commerce, travel, or group meetings. Accordingly, the mayor’s statement would not be a governmental order for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\nExample 3: A restaurant is ordered by a local health department to close due to a health code violation. Since the order is unrelated to COVID-19, it would not be considered a governmental order for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\n29. If an employer voluntarily suspends operation of a trade or business or reduces hours due to COVID-19, even though that is not required by a governmental order, is the employer eligible to receive the Employee Retention Credit?\nAn employer that voluntarily suspends operation of a trade or business or reduces hours and is not subject to any governmental orders that restrict its operations is not eligible for the Employee Retention Credit on the basis of a full or partial suspension of its operations due to a governmental order. However, an employer that voluntarily suspends operations due to COVID-19 may be eligible for the Employee Retention Credit if it experiences a significant decline in gross receipts.\nFor more information about the application of this rule to an employer that operates a trade or business in multiple locations, see Is an employer that operates a trade or business in multiple locations and is subject to a governmental order requiring full or partial suspension of its operations in some jurisdictions, but not in others, considered to have a suspension of operations?. For more information on what constitutes a significant decline in gross receipts, see Determining When an Employer is Considered to have a Significant Decline in Gross Receipts."

Any Eligible Employer may elect not to apply the Employee Retention Credit for any calendar quarter by not claiming the credit on the employer’s employment tax return.\n94. May an Eligible Employer change an election to forego the Employee Retention Credit?\nYes. If an Eligible Employer elected not to claim the Employee Retention Credit in one calendar quarter, the Eligible Employer is not prohibited from claiming the credit in a subsequent calendar quarter for qualified wages paid in that subsequent quarter provided it meets the requirements to claim the credit. In addition, an Eligible Employer can file a claim for refund and make an interest-free adjustment for a prior quarter to claim the Employee Retention Credit to which it was entitled in a prior quarter, following the rules and procedures for making such claims or adjustments. See the instructions to Form 941-X, Adjusted Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund. However, qualified wages paid during the first quarter of 2020 should be reported on the employer’s second quarter Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Tax Return. Therefore, an employer should not file a Form 941-X to make an adjustment for qualified wages paid during the first quarter of 2020. See How does an Eligible Employer report qualified wages paid in the first quarter of 2020?\nExample: Employer H paid qualified wages during the second quarter of 2020 but did not claim an Employee Retention Credit on its second quarter 2020 Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Tax Return. If Employer H subsequently decides to claim the credit for the second quarter of 2020, Employer H should file a Form 941-X within the appropriate timeframe to make an adjustment. Employer H should not use its third quarter 2020 Form 941 to claim an Employee Retention Credit for qualified wages paid in the second quarter of 2020."

      "main_content": "COVID-19-Related Employee Retention Credits: General Information FAQs\n1. What is the Employee Retention Credit?\nThe Employee Retention Credit is a fully refundable tax credit for employers equal to 50 percent of qualified wages (including allocable qualified health plan expenses) that Eligible Employers pay their employees. This Employee Retention Credit applies to qualified wages paid after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021. The maximum amount of qualified wages taken into account with respect to each employee for all calendar quarters is $10,000, so that the maximum credit for an Eligible Employer for qualified wages paid to any employee is $5,000\n2. Who is an Eligible Employer? (updated November 16, 2020)\nEligible Employers for the purposes of the Employee Retention Credit are employers that carry on a trade or business during calendar year 2020, including tax-exempt organizations, that either:\nFully or partially suspend operation during any calendar quarter in 2020 due to orders from an appropriate governmental authority limiting commerce, travel, or group meetings (for commercial, social, religious, or other purposes) due to COVID-19; or\nExperience a significant decline in gross receipts during the calendar quarter.\nNote: Governmental employers are not Eligible Employers for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. However, tribal governments and tribal entities may be Eligible Employers. See Are tribal governments and tribal entities eligible for the Employee Retention Credit? Also, self-employed individuals are not eligible for this credit for their own self-employment earnings, though they may be able to claim the credit for wages paid to their employees\nFor more information, see Determining Which Employers are Eligible to Claim the Employee Retention Credit.\n3. When is the operation of a trade or business partially suspended for the purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?\nThe operation of a trade or business is partially suspended if an appropriate governmental authority imposes restrictions on the employer’s operations by limiting commerce, travel, or group meetings (for commercial, social, religious, or other purposes) due to COVID-19 such that the employer can still continue some, but not all of its typical operations.\nFor more information, see Determining When an Employer’s Trade or Business Operations are Considered to be Fully or Partially Suspended Due to a Governmental Order.\n4. What is a \"significant decline in gross receipts\"?\nA significant decline in gross receipts begins with the first calendar quarter in 2020 in which an employer’s gross receipts are less than 50 percent of its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019. The significant decline in gross receipts ends with the first calendar quarter that follows the first calendar quarter in which the employer’s 2020 quarterly gross receipts are greater than 80 percent of its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019, or with the first calendar quarter of 2021.\nFor more information, see Determining When an Employer is Considered to have a Significant Decline in Gross Receipts.\n5. How is the maximum amount of the Employee Retention Credit available to Eligible Employers determined?\nThe Employee Retention Credit equals 50 percent of the qualified wages (including qualified health plan expenses) that an Eligible Employer pays in a calendar quarter. The maximum amount of qualified wages taken into account with respect to each employee for all calendar quarters is $10,000, so that the maximum credit for qualified wages paid to any employee is $5,000.\nFor more information, see Determining When an Employer is Considered to have a Significant Decline in Gross Receipts.\n6. What are \"qualified wages\"?\nQualified wages are wages (as defined in section 3121(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”)) and compensation (as defined in section 3231(e) of the Code) paid by an Eligible Employer to some or all employees after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021. Qualified wages include the Eligible Employer’s qualified health plan expenses that are properly allocable to the wages.\nThe definition of qualified wages depends, in part, on the average number of full-time employees (as defined in section 4980H of the Code) employed by the Eligible Employer during 2019.\nIf the Eligible Employer averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, qualified wages are the wages paid to an employee for time that the employee is not providing services due to an economic hardship, specifically, either (1) a full or partial suspension of operations by order of a governmental authority due to COVID-19, or (2) a significant decline in gross receipts. For these employers, qualified wages taken into account for an employee may not exceed what the employee would have been paid for working an equivalent duration during the 30 days immediately preceding the period of economic hardship described in (1) or (2) above.\nIf the Eligible Employer averaged 100 or fewer full-time employees in 2019, qualified wages are the wages paid to any employee during any period of economic hardship described in (1) or (2) above.\nFor more information, see Determining Qualified Wages.\n7. What are \"qualified health plan expenses\"?\nQualified health plan expenses are amounts paid or incurred by an Eligible Employer that are properly allocable to employees’ qualified wages to provide and maintain a group health plan, but only to the extent that these amounts are excluded from the employees’ gross income.\nFor more information, see Determining the Amount of Allocable Qualified Health Plan Expenses.\n8. Is an Employer required to pay qualified wages to its employees under the CARES Act?\nNo. The CARES Act does not require employers to pay qualified wages. In addition, Eligible Employers may elect to not claim the Employee Retention Credit.\n9. Can Eligible Employers claim the Employee Retention Credit for qualified wages paid in March 2020?\nEligible Employers may claim the Employee Retention Credit for qualified wages that they pay after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021. Therefore, an Eligible Employer may be able to claim the credit for qualified wages paid as early as March 13, 2020.\n10. May an Eligible Employer receive the Employee Retention Credit for wages paid after December 31, 2020?\n10. May an Eligible Employer receive the Employee Retention Credit for wages paid after December 31, 2020?\n11. Against what employment taxes does the Employee Retention Credit apply?\nThe credit is allowed against the employer’s share of social security taxes under section 3111(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), and the portion of taxes imposed on railroad employers under section 3221(a) of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA) that corresponds to the social security taxes under section 3111(a) of the Code.\n12. What makes the Employee Retention Credit \"fully refundable\"?\nThe credit is fully refundable because the Eligible Employer may get a refund if the amount of the credit is more than certain federal employment taxes the Eligible Employer owes. That is, if for any calendar quarter the amount of the credit the Eligible Employer is entitled to exceeds the employer’s share of the social security tax on all wages (or on all compensation for employers subject to RRTA) paid to all employees, then the excess is treated as an overpayment and refunded to the employer under sections 6402(a) and 6413(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). Consistent with its treatment as an overpayment, the excess will be applied to offset any remaining tax liability on the employment tax return and the amount of any remaining excess will be reflected as an overpayment on the return. Like other overpayments of federal taxes, the overpayment will be subject to offset under section 6402(a) of the Code prior to being refunded to the employer.\nFor more information on the reduction in deposits for the credit and deferral of payment and deposit of the employer’s share of social security taxes due before January 1, 2021 under section 2302 of the CARES Act, see Deferral of employment tax deposits and payments through December 31, 2020.\nFor more information on the claiming the refundable Employee Retention Credit, see How to Claim the Employee Retention Credit.\n13. Are Eligible Employers required to withhold federal employment taxes on qualified wages paid to employees?\nYes. Qualified wages are wages subject to withholding of federal income tax and both the employer’s and employee’s shares of social security and Medicare taxes. (See How to Claim the Employee Retention Credit for information regarding an Eligible Employer’s ability to retain the federal income tax withholding and the employees share of social security and Medicare taxes in an amount equal to the Employee Retention Credit.) Qualified wages are also considered wages for purposes of other benefits that the employer provides, such as contributions to 401(k) plans.\n14. May an Eligible Employer receive both the tax credit for qualified leave wages under the FFCRA and the Employee Retention Credit under the CARES Act?\nYes, but not for the same wages. The amount of qualified wages for which an Eligible Employer may claim the Employee Retention Credit does not include the amount of qualified sick and family leave wages for which the employer receives tax credits under the FFCRA.\nFor more information, see Interaction with Other Credit and Relief Provisions.\n15. May an Eligible Employer receive both the Employee Retention Credit and a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan that is authorized under the CARES Act?\nNo. An Eligible Employer may not receive the Employee Retention Credit if the Eligible Employer receives a PPP loan that is authorized under the CARES Act. An Eligible Employer that receives a PPP loan should not claim Employee Retention Credits.\nFor more information, see Interaction with Other Credit and Relief Provisions."

      "main_content": "Related Employee Retention Credits: How to Claim the Employee Retention Credit FAQs\n72. How does an Eligible Employer claim the Employee Retention Credit for qualified wages?\nEligible Employers will report their total qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit for each calendar quarter on their federal employment tax returns, usually Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return. Employers also report any qualified sick leave and qualified family leave wages for which they are entitled to a credit under FFCRA on Form 941. The Form 941 is used to report income and social security and Medicare taxes withheld by the employer from employee wages, as well as the employer’s share of social security and Medicare tax.\nIn anticipation of receiving the Employee Retention Credit, Eligible Employers can fund qualified wages by: (1) accessing federal employment taxes, including withheld taxes that are required to be deposited with the IRS, and (2) requesting an advance of the credit from the IRS for the amount of the credit that is not funded by accessing the federal employment tax deposits, by filing Form 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due to COVID-19.\nFor more information, see Deferral of employment tax deposits and payments through December 31, 2020.\nThe IRS recently posted Frequently Asked Questions addressing the employer’s ability to defer the deposit of all of the employer’s share of social security taxes due before January 1, 2021 under section 2302 of the CARES Act and reduce other employment taxes required to be deposited in an amount equal to the FFCRA sick leave and family leave credits and the Employee Retention Credit.\nExample: Employer E paid $10,000 in qualified wages (including qualified health plan expenses) and, after deferral of the employer’s share of social security tax, is otherwise required to deposit $8,000 in federal employment taxes for all of its employees for wage payments made during the same quarter as the $10,000 in qualified wages. Employer E has no paid sick or family leave credits under the FFCRA. Employer E may keep up to $5,000 of the $8,000 of taxes Employer E was going to deposit, and it will not owe a penalty for keeping the $5,000. Employer E will later account for the $5,000 it retained when it files Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return, for the quarter.\n73. May an Eligible Employer reduce its federal employment tax deposit by the qualified wages that it has paid without incurring a failure to deposit penalty?\nYes. An Eligible Employer that pays qualified wages in a calendar quarter will not be subject to a penalty under section 6656 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) for failing to deposit federal employment taxes if:\nthe Eligible Employer paid qualified wages to its employees in the calendar quarter before the required deposit\nthe total amount of federal employment taxes that the Eligible Employer does not timely deposit, reduced by (a) any amount of the employer’s share of social security tax deferred under section 2302 of the CARES Act, and (b) any amount of federal employment taxes not deposited in anticipation of the credits claimed for paid sick and/or family leave under the FFCRA, is less than or equal to the amount of the Eligible Employer’s anticipated Employee Retention Credit for the qualified wages for the calendar quarter as of the time of the required deposit, and\nthe Eligible Employer did not seek payment of an advance credit by filing Form 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due to COVID-19 , with respect to any portion of the anticipated credits it relied upon to reduce its deposits.\nthe Eligible Employer did not seek payment of an advance credit by filing Form 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due to COVID-19, with respect to any portion of the anticipated credits it relied upon to reduce its deposits.\nFor more information, about the relief from the penalty for failure to deposit federal employment taxes on account of qualified wages, see Notice 2020-22 PDF and FAQs addressing the deferral of the deposit of all of the employer’s share of social security taxes under section 2302 of the CARES Act and the reduction in deposits for credits, Deferral of employment tax deposits and payments through December 31, 2020.\nExample: Employer F is an Eligible Employer that does not receive a Paycheck Protection Program loan. In its first payroll period of the second quarter of 2020, Employer F pays $10,000 in qualified wages and $3,500 in qualified sick and family leave wages under the FFCRA, among other wages for the payroll period. Employer F has a federal employment tax deposit obligation of $9,000 for the first payroll period of the second quarter of 2020 (of which $1,500 relates to the employer’s share of social security tax) prior to (a) any deferral of the deposit of the employer’s share of social security tax under section 2302 of the CARES Act and (b) any amount of federal employment taxes not deposited in anticipation of credits for qualified sick and family leave wages under the FFCRA. Employer F reasonably anticipates a $5,000 Employee Retention Credit (50 percent of qualified wages) and a $3,500 credit for paid sick and family leave (100 percent of qualified sick and family leave wages) thus far for the second quarter.\nEmployer F first defers deposit of the $1,500 employer’s share of social security tax under section 2302 of the CARES Act. This preliminarily results in a remaining federal employment tax deposit obligation of $7,500. Employer F then reduces this federal employment tax deposit obligation by the $3,500 anticipated credit for qualified sick and family leave wages, leaving a federal employment tax deposit obligation of $4,000. Finally, Employer F further reduces the deposit of all remaining federal employment taxes by $4,000 for the $5,000 anticipated Employee Retention Credit for qualified wages. Employer F will not incur a failure to deposit penalty under section 6656 of the Code for reducing its federal employment tax deposit for the first payroll period of the second quarter to $0.\nThe amount of the excess $1,000 in Employee Retention Credit available is refundable as an overpayment. Employer F may file a Form 7200 to request a credit or refund of this amount in advance of the close of the quarter (but not for any amount of the Employee Retention Credit that was already used to reduce the deposit obligation). If Employer F does not request an advance, it may request that the $1,000 overpayment be credited or refunded when it files its second quarter Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return.\nEmployer F may defer payment of the $1,500 employer’s share of social security tax (along with any other employer social security tax imposed under section 3111(a) for the quarter) on its Form 941 for the second quarter of 2020. Employer F will not be required to pay any portion of the deferred amount until December 31, 2021, at which time 50 percent is due ($750), with the remaining amount ($750) due December 31, 2022. If Employer F fails to pay the required amounts at those times, Employer F’s deferred deposits will lose their deferred status and may be subject to failure to deposit penalties from their original due dates. Employer F may also be subject to failure to pay penalties accruing from the deferred due date for payment.\n74. Can an Eligible Employer receive an advance of the Employee Retention Credit to fund the payment of qualified wages if the Eligible Employer does not have sufficient federal employment taxes set aside for deposit to cover those payments?\nYes. An employer that is treated as a single employer under the aggregation rules, may not receive the Employee Retention Credit if any member of the employer’s aggregated group receives a PPP loan. For more information on the aggregation rules, see Determining Which Entities are Considered a Single Employer Under the Aggregation Rules.\n75. For Eligible Employers that include multiple entities aggregated and treated as one employer for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, will the individual entities separately report their credit on their employment tax returns?\nYes. Each Eligible Employer will report its Employee Retention Credit on its employment tax return (or on its third party payer’s employment tax return) without regard to its aggregation with other entities as one employer for purposes of determining its eligibility for the credit. Each Eligible Employer’s credit will be the amount of the credit apportioned among the members of the aggregated group on the basis of each member’s proportionate share of the qualified wages giving rise to the credit.\n76. How does an Eligible Employer report qualified wages paid in the first quarter of 2020?\nAn Eligible Employer that pays qualified wages in the first quarter of 2020 should report those wages on Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return, for the second quarter of 2020.\n77. How does an Eligible Employer obtain Form 7200, and where should it send its completed form to receive the advance credit? Is there a minimum advance amount that can be claimed on a Form 7200? (Updated July 2, 2020)\nAn Eligible Employer may obtain Form 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due To COVID-19 online and may fax its completed form to 855-248-0552. After July 2, the minimum advance amount that can be claimed on a Form 7200 is $25. A Form 7200 requesting an advance of less than $25 will not be processed. Taxpayers can claim credits of less than $25 on the Form 941.\n77a. Who can sign a Form 7200? Should a taxpayer submit additional documents to confirm that a person is authorized to sign a Form 7200? (Updated July 9, 2020)\nThe instructions for Form 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due to COVID-19, provide information on who may properly sign a Form 7200 for each type of entity. For corporations, the instructions provide that the president, vice president, or other principal officer who is duly authorized may sign a Form 7200. For partnerships (including an LLC treated as a partnership) or unincorporated organizations, a responsible and duly authorized partner, member, or officer having knowledge of the entity’s affairs may sign a Form 7200. For a single-member LLC treated as a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes, the instructions provide that the owner or a principal officer who is duly authorized may sign the Form. For trusts or estates, the instructions provide that the fiduciary may sign the Form 7200. Additionally, the instructions provide that a Form 7200 may be signed by a duly authorized agent of the taxpayer if a valid power of attorney has been filed.\nIn many circumstances, whether the person signing the Form 7200 is duly authorized or has knowledge of the partnership’s or unincorporated organization’s affairs is not apparent on the Form 7200. To help expedite and ensure proper processing of Forms 7200, if a taxpayer has duly authorized an officer, partner, or member to sign Form 7200 (and that person is not otherwise explicitly permitted to sign the Form 7200 by nature of their job title), the taxpayer should submit a copy the Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative, authorizing the person to sign the Form 7200 with the Form 7200.\n77b. When should the name and EIN of a third-party payer be included on Form 7200? (added September 30, 2020)\nEmployers who file Form 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due to COVID-19, to claim an advance payment of credits are required to include on the form the name and EIN of the third party payer they use to file their employment tax returns (such as the Form 941) if the third party payer uses its own EIN on the employment tax returns. This will ensure advance payment of the credits received by the common law employer is properly reconciled to the employment tax return filed by the third-party payer for the calendar quarter for which the advance payment of the credits is received.\nTo help expedite and ensure proper processing of Form 7200 and reconciliation of advance payment of the credits to the employment tax return for the calendar quarter, only those third party payers who will file an employment tax return on behalf of an employer using the third party payer’s name and EIN should be listed on the Form 7200. Typically, CPEOs, PEOs, and other 3504 agents fall into this category of third-party payers\nIf a third party payer will file the employment tax return on an employer’s behalf using the employer’s name and EIN and not the name and EIN of the third party payer, the employer should not include the name and EIN of the third party payer on the Form 7200. Typically, reporting agents and payroll service providers fall into this category of third-party payers.\n77c. If a common law employer uses a third-party payer for only a portion of its workforce, should the employer list the third-party payer on the Form 7200? (added September 30, 2020)\nIn some cases, a common law employer may use the services of a third-party payer (such as a CPEO, PEO, or other section 3504 agent) to pay wages for only a portion of its workforce. In those circumstances, the third party payer files an employment tax return (such as the Form 941) for wages it paid to employees under its name and EIN, and the common law employer files an employment tax return for wages it paid directly to employees under its own name and EIN.\nIf the common law employer is claiming advance payments of credits for both wages paid directly to employees that will be reported on its own employment tax return and wages paid to other employees by a third party payer that will be reported on the third party payer’s employment tax return, two separate Forms 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due to COVID-19, should be filed: one for the wages paid by the common law employer with the name and EIN of the employer, and one for the wages paid by the third party payer with the name and EIN of both the common law employer and the third party payer.\nTo help expedite and ensure proper processing of Form 7200 and reconciliation of advance payment of the credits to the employment tax return when an employer uses a third party payer such as a CPEO, PEO, or other section 3504 agent for only a portion of their workforce, a common law employer should include the name and EIN of the third party payer only on the Form 7200 for advance payment of the credits for wages paid by the third party payer and reported on the third party payer’s employment tax return. The common law employer should not include the name and EIN of the third-party payer on the Form 7200 for advance payments of the credits claimed for wages paid by the common law employer and reported on the common law employer’s employment tax return."

      "main_content": "COVID-19-Related Employee Retention Credits: Amount of Allocable Qualified Health Plan Expenses FAQs\n62. How is the amount of qualified health plan expenses that is treated as qualified wages determined?\nGenerally, the qualified health plan expense is the amount that is allocable to the hours for which the employees receive other qualified wages. See:\nMay an Eligible Employer that averaged 100 or fewer full-time employees in 2019 treat its health plan expenses as “qualified wages” for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?\nMay an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 employees in 2019 treat its health plan expenses as qualified wages if it continues the employees’ health care coverage, but does not pay the employees’ wages for the time for which the employees are not providing services?\nMay an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019 treat its health plan expenses as qualified wages if it continues the employees’ health care coverage and pays its employees a reduced amount of wages for the time the employees are not providing services?\nQualified health plan expenses are properly treated as qualified wages if the allocation is made on a pro rata basis among covered employees (for example, the average premium for all employees covered by a policy) and pro rata on the basis of periods of coverage (relative to the time periods for which such wages relate).\n63. Does the amount of qualified health plan expenses include both the portion of the cost paid by the Eligible Employer and the portion of the cost paid by the employee?\nThe amount of qualified health plan expenses taken into account in determining the amount of qualified wages generally includes both the portion of the cost paid by the Eligible Employer and the portion of the cost paid by the employee with pre-tax salary reduction contributions. However, the qualified health plan expenses should not include amounts that the employee paid for with after-tax contributions.\n64. May an Eligible Employer that averaged 100 or fewer full-time employees in 2019 treat its health plan expenses as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit? (updated May 7, 2020)\nYes. An Eligible Employer that averaged 100 or fewer full-time employees in 2019 may treat its health plan expenses paid or incurred, after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021, during any period in a calendar quarter in which the employer’s business operations are fully or partially suspended due to a governmental order or a calendar quarter in which the employer experiences a significant decline in gross receipts as qualified wages, subject to the maximum of $10,000 per employee for all calendar quarters for all qualified wages. Eligible Employers may treat health plan expenses allocable to the applicable periods as qualified wages even if the employees are not working and the Eligible Employer does not pay the employees any wages for the time they are not working.\nExample 1: Employer Y averaged 100 or fewer employees in 2019. Employer Y is subject to a governmental order that partially suspends the operation of its trade or business. In response to the governmental order, Employer Y reduces all employees’ hours by 50 percent. It pays wages to the employees only for the time the employees are providing services, but Employer Y continues to provide the employees with full health care coverage. Employer Y’s health plan expenses allocable to wages paid during the period its operations were partially suspended may be treated as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\nExample 2: Employer Z averaged 100 or fewer employees in 2019. Employer Z is subject to a governmental order that suspends the operation of its trade or business. In response to the governmental order, Employer Z lays off or furloughs all of its employees. It does not pay wages to its employees for the time they are laid off or furloughed and not working, but it continues the employees’ health care coverage. Employer Z’s health plan expenses allocable to the period its operations were partially suspended may be treated as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\n65. May an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019 treat its health plan expenses as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit? (updated May 7, 2020)\nYes. An Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019 may treat its health plan expenses paid or incurred, after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021, allocable to the time that the employees are not providing services during any period in a calendar quarter in which the employer’s business operations are fully or partially suspended due to a governmental order or a calendar quarter in which the employer experiences a significant decline in gross receipts as qualified wages, subject to the maximum of $10,000 per employee for all calendar quarters for all qualified wages. However, an Eligible Employer may not treat health plan expenses allocable to the time for which the employees are receiving wages for providing services as qualified wages; only the portion of health plan expenses allocable to the time that the employees are not providing services are treated as qualified wages.\nExample 1: Employer A averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019. Employer A is subject to a governmental order that partially suspends the operation of its trade or business. In response to the governmental order, Employer A reduces all employees’ hours by 50 percent and pays wages to its employees only for the time that the employees are providing services, but Employer A continues to provide the employees with full health care coverage. Employer A’s health plan expenses allocable to the time that employees are not providing services may be treated as qualified wages. However, Employer A may not treat health plan expenses allocable to the time for which the employees are receiving wages for providing services as qualified wages.\nExample 2: Employer B averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019. Employer B is subject to a governmental order that partially suspends the operations of its trade or business. In response to the governmental order, Employer B reduces its employees’ hours by 50 percent, but it reduces its employees’ wages by only 40 percent, so that the employees receive 60 percent of their wages for 50 percent of their normal hours. Employer B continues to cover 100 percent of the employees’ health plan expenses. In this case, Employer B may treat as qualified wages: (i) the 10 percent of the wages that it pays employees for time the employees are not providing services, plus (ii) 50 percent of the health plan expenses, because the health plan expenses are allocable to the time that employees were not providing services.\nExample 3: Employer C is subject to a governmental order that fully suspends the operations of its trade or business. Employer C lays off or furloughs its employees and does not pay wages to the employees, but does continue to cover 100 percent of the employees’ health plan expenses. In this case, Employer C may treat as qualified wages the health plan expenses that are allocable to the time that the employees are not providing services.\n66. For an Eligible Employer that sponsors more than one plan for its employees (for example, both a group health plan and a health flexible spending arrangement (health FSA)), or more than one plan covering different employees, how are the qualified health plan expenses for each employee determined?\nThe qualified health plan expenses are determined separately for each plan. Then, for each plan, those expenses are allocated to the employees who participate in that plan. In the case of an employee who participates in more than one plan, the allocated expenses of each plan in which the employee participates are aggregated for that employee.\n67. For an Eligible Employer who sponsors a fully-insured group health plan, how are the qualified health plan expenses of that plan allocated to the qualified wages on a pro rata basis?\nAn Eligible Employer who sponsors a fully-insured group health plan may use any reasonable method to determine and allocate the plan expenses, including (1) the COBRA applicable premium for the employee typically available from the insurer, (2) one average premium rate for all employees, or (3) a substantially similar method that takes into account the average premium rate determined separately for employees with self-only and other than self-only coverage.\nIf an Eligible Employer chooses to use one average premium rate for all employees, the allocable amount for each day an employee covered by the insured group health plan is entitled to qualified wages could be determined using the following steps:\nThe Eligible Employer’s overall annual premium for the employees covered by the policy is divided by the number of employees covered by the policy to determine the average annual premium per employee.\nThe average annual premium per employee is divided by the average number of work days during the year by all covered employees (treating days of paid leave as a work day and a work day as including any day on which work is performed) to determine the average daily premium per employee. For example, a full-year employee working five days per week may be treated as working 52 weeks x 5 days or 260 days. Calculations for part-time and seasonal employees who participate in the plan should be adjusted as appropriate. Eligible Employers may use any reasonable method for calculating part-time employee work days.\nThe resulting premium should be adjusted to reflect any portion that employees contribute after-tax.\nThe resulting amount is the amount allocated to each day of qualified wages.\nExample: Employer D sponsors an insured group health plan that covers 400 employees, some with self-only coverage and some with family coverage. Each employee is expected to have 260 work days a year. (Five days a week for 52 weeks.) The employees contribute a portion of their premium by pre-tax salary reduction, with different amounts for self-only and family. The total annual premium for the 400 employees is $5.2 million. (This includes both the amount paid by the Eligible Employer and the amounts paid by employees through salary reduction.)\nFor an Eligible Employer using one average premium rate for all employees, the average annual premium rate is $5.2 million divided by 400, or $13,000. For each employee expected to have 260 work days a year, this results in a daily average premium rate equal to $13,000 divided by 260, or $50. That $50 is the amount of qualified health plan expenses allocated to each day of qualified wages per employee.\n68. For an Eligible Employer who sponsors a self-insured group health plan, how are the qualified health plan expenses of that plan allocated to the qualified wages on a pro rata basis?\nAn Eligible Employer who sponsors a self-insured group health plan may use any reasonable method to determine and allocate the health plan expenses, including (1) the COBRA applicable premium for the employee typically available from the administrator, or (2) any reasonable actuarial method to determine the estimated annual expenses of the plan.\nIf the Eligible Employer uses a reasonable actuarial method to determine the estimated annual expenses of the plan, then rules similar to the rules for insured plans are used to determine the amount of health plan expenses allocated to an employee. That is, the estimated annual expense is divided by the number of employees covered by the plan, and that amount is divided by the average number of work days during the year by the employees (treating days of paid leave as work days and any day on which an employee performs any work as work days). The resulting amount is the amount allocated to each day of qualified wages. Adjustments should be made for employee after-tax contributions.\n69. For an Eligible Employer who sponsors a health savings account (HSA), or Archer Medical Saving Account (Archer MSA) and a high deductible health plan (HDHP), are contributions to the HSA or Archer MSA included in the qualified health plan expenses?\nThe amount of qualified health plan expenses does not include Eligible Employer contributions to HSAs or Archer MSAs. Eligible Employers who sponsor an HDHP should calculate the amount of qualified health plan expenses in the same manner as an insured group health plan, or a self-insured plan, as applicable.\n70. For an Eligible Employer who sponsors a health reimbursement arrangement (HRA), a health flexible spending arrangement (health FSA), or a qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangement (QSEHRA), are contributions to the HRA, health FSA, or QSEHRA included in the qualified health plan expenses?\nThe amount of qualified health plan expenses may include contributions to an HRA (including an individual coverage HRA), or a health FSA, but does not include contributions to a QSEHRA. To allocate contributions to an HRA or a health FSA, Eligible Employers should use the amount of contributions made on behalf of the particular employee.\n71. Are qualified health plan expenses allocable to qualified leave wages excluded from the definition of qualified wages?\nYes. Wages for which an Eligible Employer may claim the Employee Retention Credit do not include the qualified sick leave and qualified family leave wages for which it claims credit under the FFCRA. This exclusion also applies to the qualified health plan expenses that are allocable to these qualified leave wages."

      "main_content": "COVID-19-Related Employee Retention Credits: Determining Qualified Wages FAQs\n48. What is the definition of \"qualified wages\"?\nQualified wages are wages (as defined in section 3121(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”)) and compensation (as defined in section 3231(e) of the Code), both determined without regard to the contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act), paid by an Eligible Employer to some or all of its employees after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021. Qualified wages include the Eligible Employer’s qualified health plan expenses that are properly allocable to the wages.\nThe specific circumstances in which wage payments by an Eligible Employer will be considered qualified wages depend, in part, on the average number of full-time employees it employed during 2019. For an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, qualified wages are the wages paid to an employee for time that the employee is not providing services due to either (1) a full or partial suspension of the employer’s business operations by a governmental order, or (2) the business experiencing a significant decline in gross receipts. For an Eligible Employer that averaged 100 or fewer full-time employees in 2019, qualified wages are the wages paid to any employee during any period in the calendar quarter in which the business operations are fully or partially suspended due to a governmental order or any calendar quarter the business is experiencing a significant decline in gross receipts.\n49. How does an Eligible Employer identify the average number of full-time employees employed during 2019?\nThe term “full-time employee” means an employee who, with respect to any calendar month in 2019, had an average of at least 30 hours of service per week or 130 hours of service in the month (130 hours of service in a month is treated as the monthly equivalent of at least 30 hours of service per week), as determined in accordance with section 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code. An employer that operated its business for the entire 2019 calendar year determines the number of its full-time employees by taking the sum of the number of full-time employees in each calendar month in 2019 and dividing that number by 12.\nAn employer that started its business operations during 2019 determines the number of its full-time employees by taking the sum of the number of full-time employees in each full calendar month in 2019 in which the employer operated its business and dividing by that number of months.\nAn employer that started its business operations during 2020 determines the number of its full-time employees by taking the sum of the number of full-time employees in each full calendar month in 2020 in which the employer operated its business and dividing by that number of months, consistent with the approach discussed above for employers that began business operations during 2019.\n50. Does an Eligible Employer identify the average number of full-time employees based on the aggregation rule?\nYes. All entities are considered a single employer for purposes of determining the employer’s average number of employees if: they are aggregated as a controlled group of corporations under section 52(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”); are partnerships, trusts or sole proprietorships under common control under section 52(b) of the Code; or are entities that are aggregated under section 414(m) or (o) of the Code.\nExample: Employers O and P each have 75 full-time employees, respectively. Employers O and P are corporations that have each issued a single class of common stock, and a single individual owns more than 80 percent of the common stock of both Employer O and Employer P. Employers O and P are therefore treated as a single Eligible Employer with more than 100 full-time employees for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. Accordingly, each is eligible for the Employee Retention Credit only for wages paid to an employee that is not providing services due to either (1) a full or partial suspension of operations by governmental order, or (2) a significant decline in gross receipts.\n51. May an Eligible Employer that averaged 100 or fewer employees during 2019 treat all wages paid to employees as qualified wages?\nYes. An Eligible Employer that averaged 100 or fewer employees during 2019 may treat all wages paid to its employees after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021, during any period in the calendar quarter in which the employer’s business operations are fully or partially suspended due to a governmental order or a calendar quarter in which the employer experiences a significant decline in gross receipts as qualified wages, subject to the maximum of $10,000 per employee for all calendar quarters.\n52. May an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees during 2019 treat all wages paid to employees as qualified wages?\nNo. Eligible Employers that averaged more than 100 full-time employees for 2019 may not treat the wages paid to employees for the time that they provide services to the employer as qualified wages. For these employers, only wages paid to employees, after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021, for the time they are not providing services during a calendar quarter in which the employer’s business operations are fully or partially suspended due to a governmental order or in which the employer experiences a significant decline in gross receipts may be treated as qualified wages.\nExample 1: Employer Q, a local chain of full service restaurants in State X that averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, is subject to a governmental order for restaurants to discontinue sit-down service to customers inside the restaurant, but may continue food or beverage sales to the public on a carry-out, drive-through, or delivery basis. Employer Q continues to pay wages to kitchen staff and certain wait staff needed to facilitate fulfillment of carry-out orders. Wages paid to these employees for the time that they provide carry-out service are not qualified wages.\nExample 2: Employer R averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019 and was forced to suspend operations at the end of the first calendar quarter in 2020. Its employees performed services during the first part of the calendar quarter but then stopped due to the suspension of operations; however, Employer R continued to pay the employees’ normal wages for the entire quarter, including the period during which they were not providing services. The wages paid during the period when employees were not providing services are qualified wages.\n53. May an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees during 2019 claim an Employee Retention Credit for an increase in the amount of wages it paid its employees during the time that employees are not providing services?\nNo. For Eligible Employers that averaged more than 100 full-time employees during 2019, qualified wages paid to an employee may not exceed what the employee would have been paid for working an equivalent duration during the 30 days immediately preceding the commencement of the full or partial suspension of the operation of the trade or business or the first day of the calendar quarter in which the employer experienced a significant decline in gross receipts. For a variable hour employee, the amount paid for working an equivalent duration during that 30-day period may be determined using any reasonable method. The method(s) that the Department of Labor has prescribed to determine the amount to pay an employee with an irregular schedule who is entitled to paid sick leave under the FFCRA would be considered reasonable for this purpose. For more information, see Department of Labor’s Temporary Rule: Paid Leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.\nExample: Employer S, a grocery store chain that averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, is subject to a governmental order limiting store hours. In response, Employer S has reduced the hours its employees work, but in order to incentivize those employees who continue to provide services, the employer increases the employees’ rate of pay by $1 an hour. Only the amounts paid to employees for time they are not providing services, and at the rate of pay in effect prior to the increase, would be considered qualified wages.\n54. May an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees during 2019 treat the wages paid to hourly and non-exempt salaried employees for hours for which they are not providing services as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?\nYes. For an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, wages paid to hourly and non-exempt salaried employees for hours that the employees were not providing services would be considered qualified wages for the purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. For an employee who does not have a fixed schedule of work, the hours for which the employee is not providing services may be determined using any reasonable method. The method that the Eligible Employer would use to determine the employee’s entitlement to leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act would be a reasonable method for this purpose. Similarly, the method(s) that the Department of Labor has prescribed to determine the number of hours for which an employee with an irregular schedule is entitled to paid sick leave under the FFCRA would be considered reasonable for this purpose. For more information, see Department of Labor’s Temporary Rule: Paid Leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.\nIt is not reasonable for the employer to treat an employee’s hours as having been reduced based on an assessment of the employee’s productivity levels during the hours the employee is working.\nWages paid to the employees for hours for which they provided services are not considered qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\nExample 1: Employer T, a manufacturing business, that averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, has several locations that are closed during the second quarter of 2020 due to a governmental order. Employer T continues to pay hourly employees who are not providing services at the closed locations 50 percent of their normal hourly wage rates. Employer T also reduced headquarters’ administrative staff hours by 40 percent, but continues to pay them at 100 percent of their normal hourly wage rates. For employees who are not providing services due to the closure of their location, but are receiving 50 percent of their normal hourly wage rates, Employer T may treat the wages paid as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. For the administrative staff whose hours were reduced by 40 percent, but who are paid for 100 percent of the normal wage rate, Employer T may treat the 40 percent of wages paid for time that these employees are not providing services as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. The 60 percent of wages that Employer T pays the administrative staff for hours during which the employees are actually providing services is not considered qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\nExample 2: Employer U, in the business of staging homes that are for sale, averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019. Employer U’s non-exempt salaried employees cannot perform their usual services of delivering and installing furniture to be used in staging houses because open houses are prohibited in its service area during the second quarter of 2020. However, the employees are required to provide Employer U with periodic status updates about furniture that has been leased out and other administrative matters. Employer U continues to pay wages to employees at their normal rates even though the employees cannot provide their normal services. Employer U has determined that its employees are working 20 percent of the time. Employer U is entitled to treat 80 percent of the wages paid as qualified wages and claim an Employee Retention Credit for 80 percent of the wages paid.\n55. May an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees during 2019 treat wages paid to exempt salaried employees for time for which they are not providing services as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?\nYes. For an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees during 2019, the wages paid after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021, to exempt salaried employees for the time that they are not providing services would be considered qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. An Eligible Employer may use any reasonable method to determine the number of hours that a salaried employee is not providing services, but for which the employee receives wages either at the employee’s normal wage rate or at a reduced wage rate. Reasonable methods include the method (or methods) the employer uses to measure exempt employees’ entitlement to leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule under the Family and Medical Leave Act, or the method the employer uses to measure exempt employees’ entitlement to and usage of paid leave under the employer’s usual practices. It is not reasonable for the employer to treat an employee’s hours as having been reduced based on an assessment of the employee’s productivity levels during the hours the employee is working.\nExample 1: Employer V, a large fitness club business that employed an average of more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, closed all of its locations in City B by order of City B’s mayor. Employer V continues to pay its exempt managerial employees their regular salaries. While the clubs are closed and there is not sufficient administrative work to occupy the managerial employees full-time, they continue to perform some accounting and similar administrative functions. Employer V has determined, based on the time records maintained by employees, that they are providing services for 10 percent of their typical work hours. In this case, 90 percent of wages paid to these employees during the period the clubs were closed are qualified wages.\nExample 2: Employer W, a large consulting firm that employed an average of more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, closed its offices due to various governmental orders and required all employees to telework. Although Employer W believes that some of its employees may not be as productive while working remotely, employees are working their normal business hours. Because employees’ work hours have not changed, no portion of the wages paid to the employees by Employer W are qualified wages.\n56. May an Eligible Employer treat wages paid to employees pursuant to a pre-existing vacation, sick and other personal leave policy as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?\nIf the Eligible Employer averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, the employer may not treat as qualified wages amounts paid to employees for paid time off for vacations, holidays, sick days and other days off. These wages are paid pursuant to existing leave policies that represent benefits accrued during a prior period in which the employees provided services and are not wages paid for time in which the employees are not providing services.\nHowever, if the Eligible Employer averaged 100 or fewer full-time employees in 2019, all wages paid to employees during the period of the full or partial suspension of operations or the significant decline in gross receipts, even if under a pre-existing vacation, sick and other leave policy, may be qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit (unless the wages are qualified sick and/or family leave wages under sections 7001 and 7003 of the FFCRA).\n57. May an Eligible Employer treat payments made to former employees who have terminated employment as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?\nNo. Payments, including severance payments, made to a former employee following termination of employment are not considered qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. Payments may be considered qualified wages only if the payments are made to an employee who continues to be employed by the Eligible Employer. Payments made in connection with a former employee’s termination of employment are not qualified wages because they are payments for the past employment relationship and thus are not attributable to the time for which the Employee Retention Credit may be claimed. See United States v. Quality Stores, Inc., 572 U.S. 141 (2014). Whether an employee has terminated employment is based on all of the facts and circumstances, including whether the employer has treated the employment relationship as terminated for purposes other than the continuation of wage payments.\n58. If an amount an Eligible Employer pays to an employee is exempt from social security and Medicare taxes, can the Eligible Employer still claim the Employee Retention Credit on the amount paid to that employee? (updated June 19, 2020)\nNo. The Employee Retention Credit is allowed on qualified wages paid to employees; an amount must constitute wages within the meaning of section 3121(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) (or must constitute qualified health plan expenses allocable to such wages) in order to fall within the definition of qualified wages.\nExample 1: A church in State X employs an ordained minister; the minister is a common law employee of the church. The governor of State X issues an executive order limiting gatherings of more than 10 people. As a result, the church suspends Sunday worship services, but continues to pay the minister’s salary and parsonage allowance. The minister’s salary and parsonage allowance do not constitute wages within the meaning of section 3121(a) of the Code and therefore are not qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\nExample 2: A group of licensed real estate agents at Real Estate Brokerage Firm Y receive substantially all their payments for services directly related to home sales and perform services under a written contract providing that they will not be treated as employees for federal tax purposes. Therefore, the licensed real estate agents at Real Estate Brokerage Firm Y are treated as statutory nonemployees under the Code. Amounts paid to the licensed real estate agents at Real Estate Brokerage Firm Y do not constitute wages within the meaning of section 3121(a) of the Code and therefore are not qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\nExample 3: Employer Z offers its employees various benefits that provide for pre-tax salary reduction contributions, including a qualified 401(k) plan, a fully-insured group health plan, a dependent care assistance program satisfying the requirements of section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), and qualified transportation benefits satisfying the requirements of section 132(f) of the Code. Employer Z also makes matching and nonelective contributions to the qualified 401(k) plan and pays the portion of the cost of maintaining the group health plan remaining after the employees’ share. Employer Z may treat as qualified wages the amounts its employees contribute as pre-tax salary reduction contributions to the qualified 401(k) plan because those amounts are wages within the meaning of section 3121(a) of the Code.\nEmployer Z may also treat all amounts paid toward maintaining the group health plan (including any employee pre-tax salary reduction contribution) as qualified health plan expenses that may be allocated to wages. See “ Does the amount of qualified health plan expenses include both the portion of the cost paid by the Eligible Employer and the portion of the cost paid by the employee? ”\nEmployer Z may not treat as qualified wages the amounts Employer Z contributes as matching or nonelective contributions to the qualified 401(k) plan, nor may it treat as qualified wages any employee pre-tax salary reduction contributions toward the dependent care assistance program or qualified transportation benefits. These amounts do not constitute wages within the meaning of section 3121(a) of the Code and therefore are not qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\n59. Are wages paid by an employer to employees who are related individuals considered qualified wages?\nNo. Wages paid to related individuals, as defined by section 51(i)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), are not taken into account for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. A related individual is any employee who has of any of the following relationships to the employee’s employer who is an individual:\nA child or a descendant of a child;\nA brother, sister, stepbrother, or stepsister;\nThe father or mother, or an ancestor of either;\nA stepfather or stepmother;\nA niece or nephew;\nAn aunt or uncle;\nA son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law.\nIn addition, if the Eligible Employer is a corporation, then a related individual is any person that bears a relationship described above with an individual owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent in value of the outstanding stock of the corporation.\nIf the Eligible Employer is an entity other than a corporation, then a related individual is any person that bears a relationship described above with an individual owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of the capital and profits interests in the entity.\nIf the Eligible Employer is an estate or trust, then a related individual includes a grantor, beneficiary, or fiduciary of the estate or trust, or any person that bears a relationship described above with an individual who is a grantor, beneficiary, or fiduciary of the estate or trust.\n60. Are there other limits on the amounts that are considered qualified wages?\nThe Eligible Employer may not treat as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit any wages for which the employer received a credit for qualified sick and/or family leave wages (sections 7001 and 7003 of the FFCRA). In addition, any qualified wages taken into account for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit cannot be taken into account for the credit for paid family medical leave under section 45S of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).\nFurther, an employee included for purposes of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit under section 51 of the Internal Revenue Code may not be included for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\nFor more information about the limits on what amounts are considered qualified wages, see Determining the Maximum Amount of an Eligible Employer’s Employee Retention Credit.\nFor more details on how the Employee Retention Credit relates to other tax credits, see Interaction with Other Credit and Relief Provisions.\n61. Do \"qualified wages\" include taxes imposed on or withheld from the wages?\nQualified wages are calculated without regard to federal taxes imposed or withheld, including the employee’s or employer’s shares of social security taxes, the employee’s and employer’s shares of Medicare tax, and federal income taxes required to be withheld."

May an Eligible Employer that receives a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan receive the Employee Retention Credit?\nNo. An employer may not receive the Employee Retention Credit if the employer receives a PPP loan that is authorized under the CARES Act. An Eligible Employer that receives a PPP loan, regardless of the date of the loan, cannot claim the Employee Retention Credit.\n79. Is an employer that repays its Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan by May 18, 2020, eligible for the Employee Retention Credit? (updated May 26, 2020)\nA. Yes. An employer that applied for a PPP loan, received payment, and repays the loan by May 18, 2020 (originally May 7, 2020, as provided by the Limited Safe Harbor With Respect to Certification Concerning Need for PPP Loan Request in the Interim Final Rules issued by the Small Business Administration (SBA) effective on April 28, 2020, but extended by FAQs 43 and 47 in the SBA’s PPP FAQs updated on May 5, 2020 and May 13, 2020, respectively), will be treated as though the employer had not received a covered loan under the PPP for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. Therefore, the employer will be eligible for the credit if the employer is otherwise an Eligible Employer. For more information, see Business Loan Program Temporary Changes; Paycheck Protection Program—Requirements—Promissory Notes, Authorizations, Affiliation, and Eligibility PDF and SBA’s PPP Loans FAQs PDF\n80. If multiple entities are treated as a single employer under the aggregation rules, and only one of these entities has received a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan, does this mean that all of the other entities in the aggregated group are not eligible for the Employee Retention Credit?\nYes. An employer that is treated as a single employer under the aggregation rules, may not receive the Employee Retention Credit if any member of the employer’s aggregated group receives a PPP loan. For more information on the aggregation rules, see Determining Which Entities are Considered a Single Employer Under the Aggregation Rules.\n81. Is an employer eligible to receive an Employee Retention Credit after the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan is forgiven?\nNo. An employer that receives a PPP loan may not receive an Employee Retention Credit, regardless of whether and when the loan is forgiven. For more information on Eligible Employers, see Determining Which Employers are Eligible to Claim the Employee Retention Credit.\n81a. How is eligibility for the Employee Retention Credit affected if an employer acquires the stock or other equity interests of a target employer that had received a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan and, under the aggregation rules, the employers are treated as a single employer as a result of the transaction? (added November 16, 2020)\nThe following rules apply for purposes of determining whether an employer (Acquiring Employer) that acquires the stock or other equity interests of an entity (Target Employer) in a transaction that results in the Target Employer becoming a member of an aggregated group with the Acquiring Employer that is treated as a single employer under the aggregation rules (the Aggregated Employer Group) is eligible for the Employee Retention Credit on and after the transaction closing date.\nPPP loan is fully satisfied or escrow established pre-transaction\nIf the Target Employer had received a PPP loan, but prior to the transaction closing date, the Target Employer fully satisfied the PPP loan in accordance with paragraph 1 of the Small Business Administration Notice effective October 2, 2020 (the SBA October 2 Notice), or submitted a forgiveness application to the PPP lender and established an interest-bearing escrow account in accordance with paragraph 2.a of the SBA October 2 Notice, then, after the closing date, the Aggregated Employer Group will not be treated as having received a PPP loan, provided that the Acquiring Employer (including any member of the Acquiring Employer’s pre-transaction Aggregated Employer Group) had not received a PPP loan before the closing date and no member of the Aggregated Employer Group receives a PPP loan on or after the closing date. In this case, any employer that is a member of the Aggregated Employer Group, including the Target Employer, may claim the Employee Retention Credit for qualified wages paid on and after the closing date, provided that the Aggregated Employer Group otherwise meets the requirements to claim the Employee Retention Credit. In addition, any Employee Retention Credit claimed by the Acquiring Employer’s pre-transaction Aggregated Employer Group for qualified wages paid before the closing date will not be subject to recapture under section 2301(l)(3) of the CARES Act.\nPPP loan is not fully satisfied and no escrow established pre-transaction\nIf the Target Employer had received a PPP loan, but prior to the transaction closing date, the PPP Loan is not fully satisfied and no escrow account was established in accordance with paragraphs 1 or 2.a of the SBA October 2 Notice, then, after the closing date, the Aggregated Employer Group (other than the Target Employer) will not be treated as having received a PPP loan, provided that the Acquiring Employer (including any member of the Acquiring Employer’s pre-transaction Aggregated Employer Group) had not received a PPP loan before the closing date and no member of the Aggregated Employer Group receives a PPP loan on or after the closing date. Any employer (other than the Target Employer) that is a member of the Aggregated Employer Group may claim the Employee Retention Credit for qualified wages paid on and after the closing date, provided that the Aggregated Employer Group otherwise meets the requirements to claim the Employee Retention Credit. In addition, any Employee Retention Credit claimed by the Acquiring Employer’s pre-transaction Aggregated Employer Group for qualified wages paid before the closing date will not be subject to recapture under section 2301(l)(3) of the CARES Act. However, the Target Employer that received the PPP loan prior to the transaction closing date and that continues to be obligated on the PPP loan after the closing date is ineligible for the Employee Retention Credit for any wages paid to any employee of the Target Employer before or after the closing date.\n81b. How is eligibility for the Employee Retention Credit affected if an employer acquires the assets of an employer that received a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan? (added November 16, 2020)\nThe following rules apply for purposes of determining whether an employer (Acquiring Employer) that acquires the assets and liabilities of an entity (Target Employer) is eligible for the Employee Retention Credit\nNo assumption of PPP loan obligations\nAn Acquiring Employer that acquires the assets of a Target Employer that had received a PPP loan will not be treated as having received a PPP loan by virtue of the asset acquisition, provided that the Acquiring Employer does not assume the Target Employer’s obligations under the PPP loan. In this case, the Acquiring Employer will be eligible for the Employee Retention Credit after the transaction closing date if the employer otherwise meets the requirements to claim the credit. In addition, any Employee Retention Credit claimed by the Acquiring Employer for qualified wages paid before the closing date will not be subject to recapture under section 2301(l)(3) of the CARES Act.\nAssumption of PPP loan obligations\nIf, as part of the acquisition of the Target Employer’s assets and liabilities, the Acquiring Employer assumes the Target Employer’s obligations under the PPP loan, then after the transaction closing date, the Acquiring Employer generally will not be treated as having received a PPP loan, provided that the Acquiring Employer had not received a PPP loan before or on or after the closing date; however, the wages that may be treated as qualified wages after the closing date will be limited. Specifically, the wages paid by the Acquiring Employer after the closing date to any individual who was employed by the Target Employer on the closing date shall not be treated as qualified wages. Subject to this limitation, the Acquiring Employer may claim the Employee Retention Credit for qualified wages paid on and after the closing date, provided that the employer otherwise meets the requirements to claim the Employee Retention Credit. In addition, any Employee Retention Credit claimed by the Acquiring Employer for qualified wages paid before the closing date will not be subject to recapture under section 2301(l)(3) of the CARES Act.\n82. May employers receive both the paid family and medical leave credit (section 45S of the Internal Revenue Code) and the Employee Retention Credit?\nYes, but not for the same wage payments.\nAny qualified wages for which an Eligible Employer claims the Employee Retention Credit may not be taken into account for purposes of determining a section 45S credit. Thus, an employer may not claim a credit under section 45S with respect to the qualified wages for which it claims the Employee Retention Credit, but it may be able to take a credit under section 45S with respect to any additional wages paid, provided the requirements of section 45S are met with respect to the additional wages.\n83. May employers receive the credits under section 51 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Work Opportunity Tax Credit or WOTC) and the Employee Retention Credit for the same employee for the same period?\nNo. An Eligible Employer may not claim the Employee Retention Credit and the WOTC for the same employee for the same period of time."

      "main_content": "COVID-19-Related Employee Retention Credits: Special Issues for Employees: Income and Deduction FAQs\n84. Are qualified wages excluded from gross income as \"qualified disaster relief payments\"?\nNo. Section 139 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) excludes from a taxpayer’s gross income certain payments to individuals to reimburse or pay for expenses related to a qualified disaster (“qualified disaster relief payments”). Although the COVID-19 outbreak is a “qualified disaster” for purposes of section 139 the Code, qualified wages are not excludible qualified disaster relief payments, because qualified wages are what an individual would otherwise earn as compensation, rather than payments to offset any particular expenses that an individual would incur due to COVID-19.\nSection 139(c)(2) of the Code provides that for purposes of section 139 of the Code, the term “qualified disaster” includes a disaster determined by the President to warrant assistance by the Federal government under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121 – 5207. The President has made such a disaster determination for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. Territories. A “qualified disaster relief payment” is defined by section 139(b) of the Code to include any amount paid to or for the benefit of an individual to reimburse or pay reasonable and necessary personal, family, living, or funeral expenses incurred as a result of a qualified disaster. Qualified disaster relief payments do not include qualified wages paid by an employer, even those that are paid when an employee is not providing services."

NO\nR&D tax credits are available to all organizations that engage in certain activities. Opportunities also exist in industries that are not known for conducting R&D activities like Software development, Agriculture, Architecture, Construction, and Engineering, Restaurants, Retail.\nIf you are conducting qualified research and development projects, it is beneficial to claim the R&D tax credit regardless of your company’s taxable income. R&D tax credits can be carried forward to offset future income tax liability. Typically, credits that cannot be used immediately will carry forward for up to 20 years. Also, companies can often claim the R&D tax credit retroactively by filing amended returns.\nExamples of R&D activities include but are not limited to the following:\nDeveloping or engineering a new or improved product, process, formula, or software\nEvaluating the feasibility of a product, process, formula, or software\nDeveloping engineering architecture\nDeveloping experimental models & prototypes\nTesting an experimental product, process,formula, or software\nBeta testing\nImproving processes or the manufacturability of a product\nTechnical design reviews\nParticipating in technical meetings\nDocumenting the results of research\nMaintaining research equipment\nCompiling research data\nFabricating experimental models\nExperimenting with innovative technologies\nCreating more efficient and environmentally friendly designs\nSupervising technical personnel engaged in R&D\nR&D Tax Credit Criteria\nQualified Purpose\nTo develop a new or improved business component including product, process, software, technique, invention, or formula to enhance functionality, performance, reliability, or quality.\nTechnological in nature\nThe business component’s development must be based on a hard science, such as computer science, engineering, biological sciences, or the physical sciences, including testing, developing models, software, patents, or prototypes.\nTechnical Uncertainty\nFrom the outset, the organization must have faced technological technical uncertainty when designing or developing the business component. For example, this technical uncertainty can be related to the capability or methodology of the development or improvement, or the appropriateness of the design.\nProcess of experimentation\nThe company must have evaluated multiple design alternatives or employed a systematic trial and error approach to overcome the technological uncertainties.\nBOOK A Free Consultation\nBook a no-obligation 15-minute consult and join thousands of other business that we are helping qualify for the program\nDocumentation\nClaiming the R&D tax credit could become easier by maintaining proper documentation. Learn what documents you will need to get the claim.\nPayroll information and timesheets for employees directly involved in R&D and for employees or managers supervising them\nGeneral ledger reports listing which business expenses and supplies were related to R&D\nCopies of contracts and invoices paid to any contractors who do third-party research for you\nTimekeeping records for work plans, payroll, meetings, and any other activities to prove they were related to R&D\nDesign drawings, test records, blueprints, progress reports, marketing materials and any other documentation that shows the process and impact of your research\nFostering America Innovation & Job Creation\nWhite paper for 2024 on Research & Development Tax Credit.\nFostering America Innovation & Job Creation\nWhite paper for 2024 on Research & Development Tax Credit.\n– FAQ’s\nWhat is the R&D tax credit?\nEstablished in 1981, this incentive rewards US-businesses for investing in research and development (R&D) activities. This incentive lowers the income tax liability for businesses that develop new or improve existing products, processes, software, or formulas.\nHow do I know if I qualify?\nThe definition of qualified activities is pretty broad. Because of this, there is no cookie cutter industry or company profile that determines eligibility. If you have developed a product, process, software, or formula that relies on either physical, biological, engineering, or computer science, it’s very likely you qualify.\nHow much is it worth?\nThe credit is generally worth 10% of your qualified expenditures such as wages, contractors, hosting and infrastructure, and supplies.\nHow do I use this credit?\nThe R&D tax credit is designed to lower a company’s tax liability. For established businesses, it is used as a direct dollar-for-dollar reduction of your income tax liability.\nIf you’re a startup, you may have the option to use this credit against the employer’s portion of social security taxes up to $250,000 per year. To be eligible as a qualified startup, you must be within your first five years of gross receipt, and be under $5 million in gross receipts for the tax year in consideration.\nI won’t have an income tax liability for this year. Is it still worth it to claim this credit?\nYes! These credits have a 20 year carry forward period to be used against future income tax liabilities.\nHow do I claim this credit?\nYou claim this credit by filing an additional tax form along with your company’s annual tax filing. Occams will prepare the necessary additional tax forms for you, and you will provide them to your CPA to be filed alongside your annual filing.\nI’ve never claimed this credit before. Can I go back and claim for previous years?\nYou can amend previous tax returns to claim any unclaimed credits. Based on the statute of limitations for amending previous returns, you can go back up to 3 years to claim the R&D credit.\nIn doing so, you may potentially get a refund based on income taxes you paid in those years, or you can carry forward those credits to future years.\nI already have a CPA. Is this something they can do for me?\nGreat! We partner with hundreds of CPAs to help their clients claim these tax incentives. We find this to be a bit of a specialty service – think of your CPA as a general practitioner, and Occams as a cardiologist.\nOccams does not file any forms on your behalf – we prepare all the necessary forms to be included with your annual filing. In this case, you would pass along our work to your CPA, and we’ll work with them as needed to make sure everything gets done accordingly.\nIs this a one-time thing?\nNo. This credit can be claimed for every year in which you incur R&D expenses. There is no limit to the number of times you can claim this credit, and there is no cap on the amount.\nWhat is the process to claim the credit?\nThere are two important parts to an R&D tax credit study: substantiation and calculation. Our team of experts will help you build the case for why you qualified for the R&D credit (substantiation), and work with you build the financial framework to calculate your credit. We try to take on most of the heavy lifting so you don’t have to. The timeline varies from company to company, but traditionally a study takes about 3-4 weeks.\nWhat do I do if I get audited?\nAs long as your filing does not contain errors, you are guaranteed to receive a credit based on the expenses you claimed. However, the IRS may request documentation to prove that your expenses meet the criteria for qualified research. This is what we’re building during our process.\nWe make sure your R&D claim is bulletproof. Even if the IRS disagrees with the amount of your credit, they won’t charge you penalties or interest, just the difference in calculation."

      "scraped_at": "2026-01-12T12:17:23.389849",
      "main_content": "COVID-19-Related Employee Retention Credits: General Information FAQs\n85. Does the Employee Retention Credit reduce the expenses that an Eligible Employer could otherwise deduct on its federal income tax return?\nYes. Section 2301(e) of the CARES Act provides that rules similar to section 280C(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) shall apply for purposes of applying the Employee Retention Credit. Section 280C(a) of the Code generally disallows a deduction for the portion of wages paid equal to the sum of certain credits determined for the taxable year. Accordingly, a similar deduction disallowance would apply under the Employee Retention Credit, such that an employer’s aggregate deductions would be reduced by the amount of the credit as result of this disallowance rule.\n86. Does an Eligible Employer receiving an Employee Retention Credit for qualified wages need to include any portion of the credit in income?\nNo. An employer receiving a tax credit for qualified wages, including allocable qualified health plan expenses, does not include the credit in gross income for federal income tax purposes. Neither the portion of the credit that reduces the employer’s applicable employment taxes, nor the refundable portion of the credit, is included in the employer’s gross income.\n87. Can an Eligible Employer that uses a third party to report and pay employment taxes to the IRS get the Employee Retention Credit?\nYes, if a common law employer is otherwise eligible to receive the Employee Retention Credit, it is entitled to the credit, regardless of whether it uses a third party payer (such as a reporting agent, payroll service provider, PEO, CPEO, or agent) to report and pay its federal employment taxes. The third party payer is not entitled to the Employee Retention Credit with respect to the wages it remits on the employer’s behalf (regardless of whether the third party is considered an “employer” for other purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”)). If an employer uses a third party to file, report, and pay employment taxes, certain rules for claiming/reporting the Employee Retention Credit will apply depending on the type of third party payer the employer uses.\nIf an Eligible Employer uses a reporting agent to file the Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return, the reporting agent will need to reflect the Employee Retention Credit on the Form 941 it files on the employer’s behalf.\nIf an Eligible Employer uses a CPEO or a 3504 agent to report its federal employment taxes on an aggregate Form 941, the CPEO or 3504 agent will report the Employee Retention Credit on its aggregate Form 941 and Schedule R, Allocation Schedule for Aggregate Form 941 Filers, that it already files. An Eligible Employer can submit its own Form 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due to COVID-19 , to claim the advance credit. The Eligible Employer will need to provide a copy of the Form 7200 to the CPEO or 3504 agent so the CPEO or 3504 agent can properly report the Employee Retention Credit on the Form 941.\nIf an Eligible Employer uses a non-certified PEO to report and pay its federal employment taxes, the PEO will need to report the Employee Retention Credit on an aggregate Form 941 and separately report the Employee Retention Credit allocable to the employers for which it is filing the aggregate Form 941 on an accompanying schedule R. The PEO does not have to complete Schedule R with respect to employers for which it is not claiming an Employee Retention Credit. The Eligible Employer will need to provide a copy of any Form 7200 that it submitted for an advance to the PEO so the PEO can properly report the Employee Retention Credit on the Form 941. These rules are similar to the rules that apply with respect to the payroll tax election available under section 41(h) of the Code for the credit for certain research and development expenses.\n88. May a payroll reporting agent sign and submit Form 7200 on behalf of a client? (updated June 19, 2020)\nA payroll reporting agent (RA) may sign Form 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due to COVID-19 , for a client for which it has the authority, via Form 8655, Reporting Agent Authorization, to sign and file the employment tax return (e.g., Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return). The signatory must be the Principal or Responsible Official listed on the RA’s e-file application. The signatory may sign with ink on paper or may use the alternative signature method (rubber stamp, mechanical device, or computer software program; for details and required documentation, see Rev. Proc. 2005-39, 2005-28 I.R.B. 82 ). Consistent with Rev. Proc. 2005-39, an alternative signature must be in the form of a facsimile signature. The RA will submit the form via fax to 855-248-0552.\nThe RA must obtain written authorization from the client (paper, fax, or e-mail) to perform these actions regarding the Form 7200. The RA need not submit that authorization to the IRS, but should retain it in its files so that the RA can furnish it to the IRS upon request. For a client for which a third party does not have a Reporting Agent Authorization, it may complete and print the form, or it may provide the client a means to complete and print the form, but the client will have to sign it.\nThe signatory for the RA must sign, date, and print his or her name in the relevant boxes on Form 7200. In the box, “Printed Title,” the signatory must include the RA company name or name of business as it appeared on line 9 of the Form 8655. If the RA company name or name of business from the Form 8655 is missing, the Form 7200 cannot be processed.\n89. What information must third party payers obtain from their client employers to claim the Employee Retention Credit on their client's behalf?\nIf a third party payer (CPEO, PEO, or 3504 agent) is claiming the Employee Retention Credit on behalf of the client employer, it must collect from the client any information necessary to accurately claim the Employee Retention Credit on its client’s behalf. This includes obtaining information with respect to the client’s claims for credits under section 45S of the Internal Revenue Code and under the FFCRA, as well as whether the client has received a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan authorized under the CARES Act.\n90. May third party payers rely on client employer information regarding the Employee Retention Credit? (updated June 19, 2020)\nIf a third party payer is claiming the Employee Retention Credit on behalf of the client employer, the third party payer may rely on the client employer’s information regarding the client employer’s eligibility to claim the Employee Retention Credit, and the client employer may maintain all records which substantiate the client’s eligibility for the Employee Retention Credit.\nHowever, upon request by the IRS, the third party payer must obtain from the client employer and provide to the IRS records that substantiate the client’s eligibility for the Employee Retention Credit. The client employer and the third party payer will each be liable for employment taxes that are due as a result of any improper claim of Employee Retention Credits that are improperly claimed in accordance with their liability under the Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations for the employment taxes reported on the employment tax return filed by the third party payer on which the credit was claimed.\n91. Upon request by the IRS, what records must third party payers obtain from their client employers to substantiate the client's eligibility for the Employee Retention Credit?\nIf a third party payer is claiming the Employee Retention Credit on behalf of the client employer, it must, at the IRS’s request, be able to obtain from the client and provide to the IRS records that substantiate client’s eligibility for the Employee Retention Credit.\n92. Are client employers responsible for avoiding a \"double benefit\" with respect to the Employee Retention Credit and the credit under section 45S of the Internal Revenue Code? (updated June 19, 2020)\nYes. The client employer is responsible for avoiding a “double benefit” with respect to the Employee Retention Credit and the credit under section 45S of the Internal Revenue Code. The client employer cannot use wages that were used to claim the Employee Retention Credit, and reported by the third-party payer on the client employer’s behalf, to claim the 45S credit on its income tax return.\n93. May an Eligible Employer elect to forego the Employee Retention Credit?\nYes. Any Eligible Employer may elect not to apply the Employee Retention Credit for any calendar quarter by not claiming the credit on the employer’s employment tax return.\n94. May an Eligible Employer change an election to forego the Employee Retention Credit?\nYes. If an Eligible Employer elected not to claim the Employee Retention Credit in one calendar quarter, the Eligible Employer is not prohibited from claiming the credit in a subsequent calendar quarter for qualified wages paid in that subsequent quarter provided it meets the requirements to claim the credit. In addition, an Eligible Employer can file a claim for refund and make an interest-free adjustment for a prior quarter to claim the Employee Retention Credit to which it was entitled in a prior quarter, following the rules and procedures for making such claims or adjustments. See the instructions to Form 941-X, Adjusted Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund. However, qualified wages paid during the first quarter of 2020 should be reported on the employer’s second quarter Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Tax Return. Therefore, an employer should not file a Form 941-X to make an adjustment for qualified wages paid during the first quarter of 2020. See How does an Eligible Employer report qualified wages paid in the first quarter of 2020?\nExample: Employer H paid qualified wages during the second quarter of 2020 but did not claim an Employee Retention Credit on its second quarter 2020 Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Tax Return. If Employer H subsequently decides to claim the credit for the second quarter of 2020, Employer H should file a Form 941-X within the appropriate timeframe to make an adjustment. Employer H should not use its third quarter 2020 Form 941 to claim an Employee Retention Credit for qualified wages paid in the second quarter of 2020."

For purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, “trade or business” has the same meaning as when used in section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) other than the trade or business of performing services as an employee. Under section 162 of the Code, an activity does not qualify as a trade or business unless its primary purpose is to make a profit and it is carried on with regularity and continuity. The facts and circumstances of each case determine whether an activity is a trade or business. A taxpayer does not necessarily need to make a profit in any particular year in order to be in a trade or business as long as a good faith profit motive is present. For purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, a tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c) of the Code that is exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Code is deemed to be engaged in a “trade or business” with respect to all operations of the organization.",

However, because tribal governments are not subject to income tax under the Code and, therefore, are generally not otherwise required to determine whether a tribal activity is a trade or business under section 162 of the Code, the Treasury Department and the IRS have concluded that the section 162 standards are not the appropriate bases for determining whether a tribal government is carrying on a trade or business for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. Instead, solely for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, a tribal government is treated as carrying on trade or business activities, and all activities conducted by the tribal government will be considered part of those trade or business activities. In addition, solely for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, any entity that a tribal government reasonably believes shares the same tax status as the tribal government (tribal entity employer) is treated as carrying on trade or business activities, and all activities conducted by the tribal entity employer will be considered part of those trade or business activities. Any entity other than a tribal government or a tribal entity employer must determine whether its activities constitute carrying on a trade or business under section 162 for purpose of determining eligibility for the Employee Retention Credit.",

Are household employers eligible for the Employee Retention Credit? No. Household employers are not considered to operate a trade or business and, therefore, are not eligible for the Employee Retention Credit, with respect to their household employees. However, household employers who are also employers operating a trade or business and who generally report employment taxes attributable to their household employees on the same Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Tax Return, or Form 944, Employer’s Annual Federal Tax Return, used to report the employment taxes attributable to the employees in the trade or business, may be eligible for the Employee Retention Credit, but only with respect to the trade or business employees and their qualified wages from the trade or business.",

How is the significant decline in gross receipts calculated? A significant decline in gross receipts is calculated by determining the first calendar quarter in 2020 (if any) in which an employer’s gross receipts are less than 50 percent of its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019. If the gross receipts decline to that extent, the employer also must later determine if there is a later calendar quarter in 2020 in which the employer’s 2020 quarterly gross receipts are greater than 80 percent of its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019. If so, the significant decline in gross receipts ends with the first calendar quarter that follows the first calendar quarter in which the employer’s 2020 quarterly gross receipts are greater than 80 percent of its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019, or with the first calendar quarter of 2021.",

Thus, Employer I’s 2020 first, second, and third quarter gross receipts were approximately 48 percent, 83 percent, and 92 percent of its 2019 first, second, and third quarter gross receipts, respectively. Accordingly, Employer I had a significant decline in gross receipts commencing on the first day of the first calendar quarter of 2020 (the calendar quarter in which gross receipts were less than 50 percent of the same quarter in 2019) and ending on the first day of the third calendar quarter of 2020 (the quarter following the quarter for which the gross receipts were more than 80 percent of the same quarter in 2019).

What are \"gross receipts\" for an employer other than a tax-exempt organization? “Gross receipts” for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit for an employer other than a tax-exempt organization has the same meaning as when used under section 448(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). Under the section 448(c) regulations, “gross receipts” means gross receipts of the taxable year and generally includes total sales (net of returns and allowances) and all amounts received for services. In addition, gross receipts include any income from investments, and from incidental or outside sources. For example, gross receipts include interest (including original issue discount and tax-exempt interest within the meaning of section 103 of the Code), dividends, rents, royalties, and annuities, regardless of whether such amounts are derived in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s trade or business. Gross receipts are generally not reduced by cost of goods sold, but are generally reduced by the taxpayer’s adjusted basis in capital assets sold. Gross receipts do not include the repayment of a loan, or amounts received with respect to sales tax if the tax is legally imposed on the purchaser of the good or service, and the taxpayer merely collects and remits the sales tax to the taxing authority.",

How does an employer that acquires a trade or business during the 2020 calendar year determine if the employer had a significant decline in gross receipts? For purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, to determine whether an employer has a significant decline in gross receipts, an employer that acquires (in an asset purchase, stock purchase, or any other form of acquisition) a trade or business during 2020 (an “acquired business”) is required to include the gross receipts from the acquired business in its gross receipts computation for each calendar quarter that it owns and operates the acquired business. Solely for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, when an employer compares its gross receipts for a 2020 calendar quarter when it owns an acquired business to its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019, the employer may, to the extent the information is available, include the gross receipts of the acquired business in its gross receipts for the 2019 calendar quarter.

(updated June 19, 2020) Solely for purposes of determining eligibility for the Employee Retention Credit, gross receipts for a tax-exempt employer include gross receipts from all operations, not only from activities that constitute unrelated trades or businesses. For example, gross receipts for this purpose include amounts received by the organization from total sales (net of returns and allowances) and all amounts received for services, whether or not those sales or services are substantially related to the organization’s exercise or performance of the exempt purpose or function constituting the basis for its exemption. Gross receipts also include the organization’s investment income, including from dividends, rents, and royalties, as well as the gross amount received as contributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts, and the gross amount received as dues or assessments from members or affiliated organizations. To determine whether there has been a significant decline in gross receipts, a tax-exempt employer computes its gross receipts received from all of its operations during the calendar quarter and compares those gross receipts to the same gross receipts received for the same calendar quarter in 2019.",

The Employee Retention Credit available to Employer M for the qualified wages paid to Employee A is $5,000. Example 2: Employer N pays $8,000 in qualified wages to Employee B in the second quarter 2020 and $8,000 in qualified wages in the third quarter 2020. The credit available to Employer N for the qualified wages paid to Employee B is equal to $4,000 in the second quarter and $1,000 in the third quarter due to the overall limit of 50 percent of $10,000 of qualified wages per employee for all calendar quarters.",

For example, an employer that maintains both essential and non-essential business operations, each of which are more than nominal portions of the business operations, may be considered to have a partial suspension of its operations if a governmental order restricts the operations of the non-essential portion of the business, even if the essential portion of the business is unaffected. In addition, an essential business that is permitted to continue its operations may, nonetheless, be considered to have a partial suspension of its operations if a governmental order requires the business to close for a period of time during normal working hours.

If a governmental order requires an employer to close its workplace for certain purposes, but the workplace may remain operational for limited purposes, is the employer considered to have a suspension of operations?

Qualified wages are wages (as defined in section 3121(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”)) and compensation (as defined in section 3231(e) of the Code) paid by an Eligible Employer to some or all employees after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021.

If the Eligible Employer averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, qualified wages are the wages paid to an employee for time that the employee is not providing services due to an economic hardship, specifically, either (1) a full or partial suspension of operations by order of a governmental authority due to COVID-19, or (2) a significant decline in gross receipts. For these employers, qualified wages taken into account for an employee may not exceed what the employee would have been paid for working an equivalent duration during the 30 days immediately preceding the period of economic hardship described in (1) or (2) above.",

That is, if for any calendar quarter the amount of the credit the Eligible Employer is entitled to exceeds the employer’s share of the social security tax on all wages (or on all compensation for employers subject to RRTA) paid to all employees, then the excess is treated as an overpayment and refunded to the employer under sections 6402(a) and 6413(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). Consistent with its treatment as an overpayment, the excess will be applied to offset any remaining tax liability on the employment tax return and the amount of any remaining excess will be reflected as an overpayment on the return. Like other overpayments of federal taxes, the overpayment will be subject to offset under section 6402(a) of the Code prior to being refunded to the employer.",

Eligible Employers will report their total qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit for each calendar quarter on their federal employment tax returns, usually Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return. Employers also report any qualified sick leave and qualified family leave wages for which they are entitled to a credit under FFCRA on Form 941. The Form 941 is used to report income and social security and Medicare taxes withheld by the employer from employee wages, as well as the employer’s share of social security and Medicare tax. In anticipation of receiving the Employee Retention Credit, Eligible Employers can fund qualified wages by: (1) accessing federal employment taxes, including withheld taxes that are required to be deposited with the IRS, and (2) requesting an advance of the credit from the IRS for the amount of the credit that is not funded by accessing the federal employment tax deposits, by filing Form 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due to COVID-19.",

Example: Employer E paid $10,000 in qualified wages (including qualified health plan expenses) and, after deferral of the employer’s share of social security tax, is otherwise required to deposit $8,000 in federal employment taxes for all of its employees for wage payments made during the same quarter as the $10,000 in qualified wages. Employer E has no paid sick or family leave credits under the FFCRA. Employer E may keep up to $5,000 of the $8,000 of taxes Employer E was going to deposit, and it will not owe a penalty for keeping the $5,000. Employer E will later account for the $5,000 it retained when it files Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return, for the quarter. 73.

For an Eligible Employer that sponsors more than one plan for its employees (for example, both a group health plan and a health flexible spending arrangement (health FSA)), or more than one plan covering different employees, how are the qualified health plan expenses for each employee determined? The qualified health plan expenses are determined separately for each plan. Then, for each plan, those expenses are allocated to the employees who participate in that plan. In the case of an employee who participates in more than one plan, the allocated expenses of each plan in which the employee participates are aggregated for that employee. 67. For an Eligible Employer who sponsors a fully-insured group health plan, how are the qualified health plan expenses of that plan allocated to the qualified wages on a pro rata basis? An Eligible Employer who sponsors a fully-insured group health plan may use any reasonable method to determine and allocate the plan expenses, including (1) the COBRA applicable premium for the employee typically available from the insurer, (2) one average premium rate for all employees, or (3) a substantially similar method that takes into account the average premium rate determined separately for employees with self-only and other than self-only coverage.",

      "content": "If an Eligible Employer chooses to use one average premium rate for all employees, the allocable amount for each day an employee covered by the insured group health plan is entitled to qualified wages could be determined using the following steps: The Eligible Employer’s overall annual premium for the employees covered by the policy is divided by the number of employees covered by the policy to determine the average annual premium per employee. The average annual premium per employee is divided by the average number of work days during the year by all covered employees (treating days of paid leave as a work day and a work day as including any day on which work is performed) to determine the average daily premium per employee. For example, a full-year employee working five days per week may be treated as working 52 weeks x 5 days or 260 days. Calculations for part-time and seasonal employees who participate in the plan should be adjusted as appropriate. Eligible Employers may use any reasonable method for calculating part-time employee work days.",

      "content": "The resulting premium should be adjusted to reflect any portion that employees contribute after-tax. The resulting amount is the amount allocated to each day of qualified wages. Example: Employer D sponsors an insured group health plan that covers 400 employees, some with self-only coverage and some with family coverage. Each employee is expected to have 260 work days a year. (Five days a week for 52 weeks.) The employees contribute a portion of their premium by pre-tax salary reduction, with different amounts for self-only and family. The total annual premium for the 400 employees is $5.2 million. (This includes both the amount paid by the Eligible Employer and the amounts paid by employees through salary reduction.) For an Eligible Employer using one average premium rate for all employees, the average annual premium rate is $5.2 million divided by 400, or $13,000. For each employee expected to have 260 work days a year, this results in a daily average premium rate equal to $13,000 divided by 260, or $50.

The term “full-time employee” means an employee who, with respect to any calendar month in 2019, had an average of at least 30 hours of service per week or 130 hours of service in the month (130 hours of service in a month is treated as the monthly equivalent of at least 30 hours of service per week), as determined in accordance with section 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code. An employer that operated its business for the entire 2019 calendar year determines the number of its full-time employees by taking the sum of the number of full-time employees in each calendar month in 2019 and dividing that number by 12. An employer that started its business operations during 2019 determines the number of its full-time employees by taking the sum of the number of full-time employees in each full calendar month in 2019 in which the employer operated its business and dividing by that number of months.

May an Eligible Employer treat wages paid to employees pursuant to a pre-existing vacation, sick and other personal leave policy as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit? If the Eligible Employer averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, the employer may not treat as qualified wages amounts paid to employees for paid time off for vacations, holidays, sick days and other days off. These wages are paid pursuant to existing leave policies that represent benefits accrued during a prior period in which the employees provided services and are not wages paid for time in which the employees are not providing services. However, if the Eligible Employer averaged 100 or fewer full-time employees in 2019, all wages paid to employees during the period of the full or partial suspension of operations or the significant decline in gross receipts, even if under a pre-existing vacation, sick and other leave policy, may be qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit (unless the wages are qualified sick and/or family leave wages under sections 7001 and 7003 of the FFCRA). 57.

      "content": "No. Payments, including severance payments, made to a former employee following termination of employment are not considered qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. Payments may be considered qualified wages only if the payments are made to an employee who continues to be employed by the Eligible Employer. Payments made in connection with a former employee’s termination of employment are not qualified wages because they are payments for the past employment relationship and thus are not attributable to the time for which the Employee Retention Credit may be claimed. See United States v. Quality Stores, Inc., 572 U.S. 141 (2014). Whether an employee has terminated employment is based on all of the facts and circumstances, including whether the employer has treated the employment relationship as terminated for purposes other than the continuation of wage payments. 58. If an amount an Eligible Employer pays to an employee is exempt from social security and Medicare taxes, can the Eligible Employer still claim the Employee Retention Credit on the amount paid to that employee? (updated June 19, 2020) No. The Employee Retention Credit is allowed on qualified wages paid to employees; an amount must constitute wages within the meaning of section 3121(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) (or must constitute qualified health plan expenses allocable to such wages) in order to fall within the definition of qualified wages.",

Does the Employee Retention Credit reduce the expenses that an Eligible Employer could otherwise deduct on its federal income tax return? Yes. Section 2301(e) of the CARES Act provides that rules similar to section 280C(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) shall apply for purposes of applying the Employee Retention Credit. Section 280C(a) of the Code generally disallows a deduction for the portion of wages paid equal to the sum of certain credits determined for the taxable year. Accordingly, a similar deduction disallowance would apply under the Employee Retention Credit, such that an employer’s aggregate deductions would be reduced by the amount of the credit as result of this disallowance rule. 86.

Proc. 2005-39, 2005-28 I.R.B. 82 ). Consistent with Rev. Proc. 2005-39, an alternative signature must be in the form of a facsimile signature. The RA will submit the form via fax to 855-248-0552. The RA must obtain written authorization from the client (paper, fax, or e-mail) to perform these actions regarding the Form 7200. The RA need not submit that authorization to the IRS, but should retain it in its files so that the RA can furnish it to the IRS upon request.
